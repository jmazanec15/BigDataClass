    "> **Note:** Every week, you will be solving exercises posed in a Jupyter notebook that looks like this one. Because you are cloning a Github repository that only I can push to, you should **NOT EDIT** any of the files you pull from Github. Instead, what you should do, is either make a new notebook and write your solutions in there, or make a copy of this notebook and **save it somewhere else** on your computer, not inside the `computational_analysis_of_big_data_2018_spring` folder that you cloned, so you can write your answers in there. If you edit the notebook you pulled from Github, those edits (possible your solutions to the exercises) may be overwritten and lost the next time you pull from Github. This is important, so don't hesitate to ask if it is unclear."

    "This document is what we call a *Jupyter notebook*. We will be using these extensively throughout the course so **READ THIS CLOSELY**. There are two basic things you need to know about Jupyter notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A notebook is nothing but a list of cells. A cell can either be a **code cell** or a **Markdown cell**. Code cells are for writing executable code, and Markdown cells (like this one) are for explaining things in text and making your notebook more readable. A typical workflow that you will soon get use to, is something like: solving a problem with some code in a *code cell* and explaining your reasoning or the results you obtained in a *Markdown cell*. You can toggle cell type when you are in *command mode* by pressing <kbd>y</kbd> for code and <kbd>m</kbd> for Markdown. **Try to do that**. Change this Markdown cell to a code cell, and change it back again. What happens if you execute (<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>enter</kbd>) this cell as code cell, compared to when it is a Markdown cell?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The notebook has two *modes*: **edit mode** and **command mode**. You enter command mode by pressing <kbd>esc</kbd> or clicking outside a cell, and edit mode by clicking a cell and pressing <kbd>enter</kbd> or double clicking a cell. When you're in edit mode, the outline of the current cell turns green and whatever you type into your keyboard goes into that cell, whether it is a code or Markdown cell. When you're in command mode, the outline of the latest edited cell turns blue and your keys become *hotkeys that execute commands*. **Beware of <kbd>x</kbd> and <kbd>d</kbd>**. Read the full list of hotkeys by pressing <kbd>h</kbd> in command mode to figure out why.\n",
    "\n",
    ">*Heads up:* Because we'll be using Jupyter notebooks so much in this course, I strongly recommend investing 5 minutes more than you would normally, playing around with cell types, modes and hotkeys. It will save you heaps of time down the road.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run a code cell by pressing <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd>, the code gets evaluated by the Python interpreter installed on your computer. The interpreter always returns some output, so unless you store it in a variable, it gets printed below the cell. In general, you will use code cells for doing analysis and working with data.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Markdown* is a simple markup language for formatting text (similar to *HTML* or $\\LaTeX$, which you may know). You will typically use it for writing explanations about how you solve the exercises and the results you get, and styling your notebook with sections and subsections. It can do **bold**, *italics* and $\\LaTeX$ formatting (for equations), and much much more. You can read about the Markdown language [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is your first exercise. The exercise are numbered by the convention `[session]`.`[section]`.`[problem]`.`[subproblem]`. For example, exercise 4.2.3.1 is in week 4, section 2, problem 3, and subproblem 1."
