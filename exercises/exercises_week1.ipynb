    "> **Note:** Every week, you will be solving exercises posed in a Jupyter notebook that looks like this one. Because you are cloning a Github repository that only I can push to, you should **NOT EDIT** any of the files you pull from Github. Instead, what you should do, is either make a new notebook and write your solutions in there, or make a copy of this notebook and **save it somewhere else** on your computer, not inside the `computational_analysis_of_big_data_2018_spring` folder that you cloned, so you can write your answers in there. If you edit the notebook you pulled from Github, those edits (possible your solutions to the exercises) may be overwritten and lost the next time you pull from Github. This is important, so don't hesitate to ask if it is unclear."

    "This document is what we call a *Jupyter notebook*. We will be using these extensively throughout the course so **READ THIS CLOSELY**. There are two basic things you need to know about Jupyter notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A notebook is nothing but a list of cells. A cell can either be a **code cell** or a **Markdown cell**. Code cells are for writing executable code, and Markdown cells (like this one) are for explaining things in text and making your notebook more readable. A typical workflow that you will soon get use to, is something like: solving a problem with some code in a *code cell* and explaining your reasoning or the results you obtained in a *Markdown cell*. You can toggle cell type when you are in *command mode* by pressing <kbd>y</kbd> for code and <kbd>m</kbd> for Markdown. **Try to do that**. Change this Markdown cell to a code cell, and change it back again. What happens if you execute (<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>enter</kbd>) this cell as code cell, compared to when it is a Markdown cell?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The notebook has two *modes*: **edit mode** and **command mode**. You enter command mode by pressing <kbd>esc</kbd> or clicking outside a cell, and edit mode by clicking a cell and pressing <kbd>enter</kbd> or double clicking a cell. When you're in edit mode, the outline of the current cell turns green and whatever you type into your keyboard goes into that cell, whether it is a code or Markdown cell. When you're in command mode, the outline of the latest edited cell turns blue and your keys become *hotkeys that execute commands*. **Beware of <kbd>x</kbd> and <kbd>d</kbd>**. Read the full list of hotkeys by pressing <kbd>h</kbd> in command mode to figure out why.\n",
    "\n",
    ">*Heads up:* Because we'll be using Jupyter notebooks so much in this course, I strongly recommend investing 5 minutes more than you would normally, playing around with cell types, modes and hotkeys. It will save you heaps of time down the road.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run a code cell by pressing <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd>, the code gets evaluated by the Python interpreter installed on your computer. The interpreter always returns some output, so unless you store it in a variable, it gets printed below the cell. In general, you will use code cells for doing analysis and working with data.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Markdown* is a simple markup language for formatting text (similar to *HTML* or $\\LaTeX$, which you may know). You will typically use it for writing explanations about how you solve the exercises and the results you get, and styling your notebook with sections and subsections. It can do **bold**, *italics* and $\\LaTeX$ formatting (for equations), and much much more. You can read about the Markdown language [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is your first exercise. The exercise are numbered by the convention `[session]`.`[section]`.`[problem]`.`[subproblem]`. For example, exercise 4.2.3.1 is in week 4, section 2, problem 3, and subproblem 1."

This time I will have more evidence and I will also includes elements of a amazing theory I heard that the story of GOT takes inspiration from Norse Mythology mainly the story of Ragnarok. There are many parallels to Norse Mythology and Ragnarok in the story but today I will be mainly focusing on two Jaime and Bran.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I will also be explaining why I believe Jaime is Azor Ahai. So I will get to the evidence of why Jaime, one of the most complex characters in the series is the Prince that was Promised/Azor Ahai Reborn.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Evidence:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Red star bleeding I think refers to either the Red Comet or the destruction of the sept as the Faith of the seven symbol is a red star. In the books case it could refer to the death of Oberyn as he is from House Martell and the sigil of House Martell is a red sun and spear which can be seen as a red star bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now being reborn admits salt and smoke can refer to anything, It could refer to when Jaime got his hand cut off as there was a fire set up there (fire as in campfire) which gives off smoke with the salt being Jaime&amp;#39;s salty sweat or tears. It can refer to his bath where he stats he is Jaime (the smoke is the steam from the bath and the salt the water), it could refer to Field of fire 2.0 with the smoke from the flames and Jaime going into salty water, or maybe it will be a event that has not happen yet like maybe when Jaime confronts Cersei again he is killed but later resurrected by a red Priest on a funeral pyre near blackwater bay (I think it&amp;#39;s obvious what the salt and smoke would be there), However in Alt Shift X&amp;#39;s vid on Jaime he stats Jaime could be resurrected when the wildfire goes off in the red keep coming out unburnt. Whatever one is the salt and smoke he could fulfill or has already fulfilled this part of the prophecy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now I do believe that Jaime is the bastard of the Mad King so that solves the blood of the dragon part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some believe Jaime&amp;#39;s hand is Lightbringer or Widow&amp;#39;s wail is Lightbringer but I believe Ice will be reforged and in a poetic act a reforged Ice will be his Lightbringer. Or maybe Widow&amp;#39;s Wail will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course Cersei is Nissa Nissa, and before you start YES I am aware Valonqar is not mentioned in the show but just because it was not does not mean Jaime will not kill Cersei.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also if we look at Jaime&amp;#39;s Journey it fits with Azor Ahai. Azor Ahai first tempered his blade in water but it broke, then he tried again this time plunging the sword into the heart of a captive lion but the steel shattered again, Then finally with all his heart he made the blade again and tempered it into the heart of his beloved wife Nissa Nissa. Now in the books it may be different as the water could be Lady Stoneheart, The Lion could be Cersei or Tyrion, and Nissa Nissa is Cersei or Brienne. For the Show the water was when he told Brienne the truth in the bath, The Lion is when he helped Tyrion escape, and Nissa Nissa is not only when he left Cersei but when he will return and kill her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Now I will get to how it relates to Ragnarok. So there are actually some parallel between GOT and the story of Ragnarok. I will not go into too much detail but I would recommend watching these two youtube videos as they are really good and give good analysis on the theory:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geqbQyx2Nug&amp;amp;t=2105s\\\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geqbQyx2Nug&amp;amp;t=2105s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4vG28iFpgg\\\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4vG28iFpgg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d also recommend reading this:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\\\"http://gameofthronesandnorsemythology.blogspot.ca/2013/05/jaime-azor-ahai-god-of-war.html\\\"&gt;http://gameofthronesandnorsemythology.blogspot.ca/2013/05/jaime-azor-ahai-god-of-war.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So as I was saying there are some parallels. These include that the Mad King is Odin, Robert Baratheon is Thor, Cersei is either Frigg or Hela, in my opinion Euron is Satur (and I may make a separate post on why I think that), Jaime is Tyr, and Bran is Fenrir. Now in the legend Fenrir was chained to the earth by Tyr, this pretty much made him angry so be bit Tyr&amp;#39;s hand off. Jaime pushed Bran out of the tower pretty much in a sense chaining him to the earth and while Bran did not bit Jaime&amp;#39;s hand off Jaime did get his hand cut off. Now this is where the theory gets interesting because if this is correct then I think sense Fenrir was a dark character in Norse Mythology then Bran could become a villain near the end with Jaime of course as Azor Ahai.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The reason for this is because in the books Bran is pretty much told be the three Eyed Raven to go into the darkness and even has him drink a paste that may or may not be Jojen Reed. Now in the show I think it may have to be something different like maybe the Bran=Night King theory ends up being true or more likely Bran is captured by the Night King and is turned into a White Walker. But what evidence do I have for this...well not too much but enough:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;ol&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bran is being setup as a dark character in the books there is what I just mentioned and he has been acting alittle off in the show not to mention kindof creepy. While Jaime has pretty much been redeemed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s obvious Jaime and Bran will meet again but Jaime I think will apologize to Bran which I think would make it harder for Jaime to have to stop him when Bran goes rouge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maisie Williams the actress who plays Arya stark stated that the ending will be something we don&amp;#39;t expect. Yes we should never take what actors or actresses say as actual evidence (especially when this is the same person who claims to love Pepperoni and Cheese Pizza and yet in one interview I saw she says she does NOT eat dairy so...yeah who knows. also sorry for getting off topic) but she did read the script so she may be telling the truth. Jaime being Azor Ahai and Bran being the villain in the end would be a good twist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been said there are three twist from the books that will happen in the show. So far those twist from what I understand are either Shireen&amp;#39;s burning or Jon&amp;#39;s resurrection and Hold the Door (Jon&amp;#39;s parentage reveal does not count as we all saw that coming). The third twist could revolve around Jaime being Azor Ahai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ol&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So too recap I believe that Jaime could be Azor Ahai and if the Ragnarok theory is true then Bran in the books could go dark from BloodRaven&amp;#39;s influence and in the show could be turned into a White Walker by the Night King. Jaime would kill Cersei to forge Lightbringer and will drive back the darkness and be forced to kill Bran and the NK in order to save everyone. Bittersweet Ending.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;\", \n",
