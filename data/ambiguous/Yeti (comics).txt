Yeti is an Inhuman mutated by the Terrigen Mist.<ref name="Fantastic Four #99">''Fantastic Four'' #99</ref>

He first appeared as a member of the superhero team [[First Line (comics)|First Line]].<ref>''Marvel: The Lost Generation'' #10</ref>

During a battle while serving with the First Line he entered the fray but lost control and became a raging beast; his teammate [[Rapunzel (comics)|Rapunzel]] used a piece of hair to distract him and he quickly calmed down.<ref>''Official Handbook to the Marvel Universe A to Z'' #13</ref>

After this incident, he left the team in shame of his behavior. He tried to return to [[Attilan]] but wound up lost in the Himalayas. He set up in an abandoned temple in the Himalayas to survive.<ref name="X-Men: The Hidden Years #16">''X-Men: The Hidden Years'' #16</ref>

After this he was found by a [[Skrull]] woman named Khoyra. She manipulated Yeti into helping her with an invasion of Earth.<ref>''Marvel: The Lost Generation'' #11</ref> The First Line repelled the attack, and Khoyra was killed by an unknown cause. Yeti took the body back to his temple and refused to leave it as it decayed.<ref>''Marvel: The Lost Generation'' #12</ref>

When [[Havok (comics)|Havok]] and [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]] were searching for a mutant that [[Cerebro]] had located, Yeti threw a boulder at them because he wanted to be alone. This knocked them out the sky. When they searched the temple, Yeti attacked them. The [[X-Men]] came to support Havok and Lorna but Yeti's rage overcame him. After a short battle, [[Pixie (Eternal)|Pixie]], another ex-member of the First Line arrived with the Inhuman Royal Family and turned Yeti to stone temporarily and explained the situation to the X-Men before allowing them to leave.<ref name="X-Men: The Hidden Years #16"/>

While looking for [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]], [[Human Torch]] arrived in the Himalayas and took refuge in a cave during a storm where he encountered Yeti. Upon seeing Human Torch's powers, Yeti mistook Human Torch for an Inhuman. Shocked by Yeti's appearance, Human Torch threw fireballs at him. Running from the fire balls, Yeti fled into Attilan warning the other Inhumans that they were under attack.<ref name="Fantastic Four #99"/>

The second Yeti is a member of the covert Canadian superhuman group [[Weapon P.R.I.M.E.]] who has fought [[X-Force]] and [[Northstar]] of [[Alpha Flight]].

It has been speculated that this Yeti is either a mutant or an intelligent [[Wendigo (comics)|Wendigo]]. Originally, the character was actually given the codename of Wendigo. Despite their similar physical appearances, the second Yeti has no connection to the other one.
