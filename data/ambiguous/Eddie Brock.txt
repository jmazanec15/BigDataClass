'''Eddie Brock''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was created by [[David Michelinie]] and [[Todd McFarlane]], and his earliest appearance was a [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] in ''[[Web of Spider-Man]]'' #18 (September 1986),<ref>''Spider-Man Saga'' #4, February 1992</ref> before making his first full appearance in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #300 (May 1988)<ref name="ComicsPriceGuide"/> as the original and most well-known incarnation of '''[[Venom (comics)|Venom]]'''. The character has since appeared in many [[Marvel Comics]] publications, including his own series ''Venom''. Introduced as a villain of [[Spider-Man]], the character becomes an [[antihero|anti-hero]], working with and against superheroes.

In the original version of the story, Eddie Brock is a journalist who exposes the identity of a serial killer only for the real killer to be caught by Spider-Man, thus he accused the wrong man. Disgraced and suicidal, he comes into contact with an alien [[Symbiote (comics)|Symbiote]], rejected by Peter Parker. The Symbiote bonds with him and they become Venom, together seeking out revenge against their mutual enemy. Though he repeatedly comes into conflict with Spider-Man, he also attempts to operate as a hero, albeit a violent one, seeking to save those he deems "innocent". In 2008, after being separated from the Venom Symbiote, he gains a new Symbiote and becomes the anti-hero '''Anti-Venom'''. However, that symbiote is sacrificed to help cure the "[[Spider-Island]]" epidemic during the 2011 storyline. In 2012, he was bonded to the [[Toxin (comics)|Toxin]] symbiote. Though he is a human with no powers, the Venom Symbiote suit bestows upon him a range of abilities including many of the powers belonging to Spider-Man, the Symbiote's original host.

Debuting in the [[Modern Age of Comic Books]], the character of Eddie Brock has featured in other Marvel-endorsed products such as [[:Category:Marvel Comics animation|animated television series]]; [[video games]]; merchandise such as [[action figure]]s, and [[trading card]]s; and the ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' feature film in which he was played by actor [[Topher Grace]], Eddie Brock is set to be portrayed by [[Tom Hardy]] in an upcoming solo film. Eddie Brock's incarnation of Venom was rated 33rd on Empire's 50 Greatest Comic Book Characters,<ref>[http://www.empireonline.com/50greatestcomiccharacters/default.asp?c=33 33 Venom], "The 50 Greatest Comic Book Characters", ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'', accessed July 2, 2011.</ref> and was the 22nd Greatest Villain on [[IGN]]'s 100 Greatest Comic Villains of All Time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/22.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100416080151/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/22.html |archivedate=2010-04-16  |title="22.

==Publication history==
{{See also|Venom (comic book)|List of Venom titles}}

===Creation and conception===
Writer [[David Michelinie]] and artist [[Todd McFarlane]] are generally credited with the character's creation, based on a number of plot ideas and concepts from various other creators. The question of who created the character of Venom became an issue of contention in 1993 when Michelinie wrote to the comic book industry magazine ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'', which had referred to Michelinie in issue #17 as "co-creator" of Venom. In his letter, printed in issue #21 (May 1993), Michelinie wrote that he was the character's sole creator, while saying also he believed that without McFarlane the character would not have attained the popularity it did.<ref>''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' #21 (May 1993)</ref>

[[Image:Amazing Spider-Man 316.jpg|thumb|right|175px|First cover appearance of Venom as depicted by co-creator Todd McFarlane]]
Writer [[Peter David]] corroborated Michelinie's view in his "But I Digress" column in the June 4, 1993 ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'', in which he stated that Michelinie discussed the ideas behind the character with him at the time of its creation. At that time, David was the writer on ''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' and wrote the "Sin Eater" storyline from which Eddie Brock's backstory would be derived, well before McFarlane was assigned to the art duties on ''Amazing''. Because artists who design the costumes or appearances of major characters and/or illustrate their first appearances are generally credited as co-creators, Venom represents a complex situation, because the costume from which Venom's appearance is derived was not designed by McFarlane.<ref name=PeterDavid>[[David, Peter]] (June 4, 1993). "[http://www.peterdavid.net/2010/07/05/the-wacko-theory/#more-4742 The Wacko Theory]", ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'', Reprinted in the collection ''But I Digress'' (1994). pp. 104–106</ref>

[[Erik Larsen]] responded to Michelinie's letter with one of his own that was printed in ''Wizard'' #23 (July 1993), in which he dismissed Michelinie's contributions to the character, arguing that Michelinie merely "swiped" the preexisting symbiote and its powers to place it on a character whose motivations were poorly conceived, one-dimensional, unbelievable, and clichéd. Larsen also argued that it was McFarlane's rendition of the character that made it commercial.<ref>''Wizard'' magazine #23, July 1993</ref>

[[Image:AmazingSpider-Man346.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Erik Larsen, who followed Todd McFarlane as artist on ''Amazing Spider-Man'', added the long tongue and drool to Venom's appearance.]]
The preexisting elements that dealt with the symbiote costume itself—to which Michelinie did not contribute—have also been noted. The original idea of a new costume for Spider-Man that would later become the character Venom was conceived of by a Marvel Comics reader from [[Norridge, Illinois]] named Randy Schueller.<ref>{{Cite web|author=Cronin, Brian|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/05/16/randy-schuellers-brush-with-comic-history/|title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed Extra: Randy Schueller’s Brush With Comic History &#124 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=May 16, 2007}}</ref> Marvel purchased the idea for $220.00 after the editor-in-chief at the time, [[Jim Shooter]], sent Schueller a letter acknowledging Marvel's desire to acquire the idea from him, in 1982. Schueller's design was then modified by [[Mike Zeck]], becoming the Symbiote costume.<ref>[http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/Spidey_005.JPG August 3, 1992 letter from Jim Shooter to Randy Schueller]. Comic Book Resources. Retrieved November 21, 2011</ref> For example, Shooter came up with the idea of switching Spider-Man to a black-and-white costume, possibly influenced by the intended costume design for the new [[Julia Carpenter|Spider-Woman]], with artists [[Mike Zeck]] and [[Rick Leonardi]], as well as others, designing the black-and-white costume.<ref name=PeterDavid/> Writer/artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] asserts on his website that the idea for a costume made of self-healing biological material was one he originated when he was the artist on '' [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] '' to explain how that character's costume was constantly being torn and then apparently repaired by the next issue, explaining that he ended up not using the idea on that title, but that [[Roger Stern]] later asked him if he could use the idea for Spider-Man's alien costume. Stern in turn plotted the issue in which the costume first appeared but then left the title. It was writer [[Tom DeFalco]] and artist [[Ron Frenz]] who had established that the costume was a sentient alien being and also that it was vulnerable to high sonic energy during their run on ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' that preceded Michelinie's.<ref>[[Byrne, John]]. [http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=7&T1=Miscellaneous+Questions#96 "How is it that JB "created" Venom?"]. "Frequently Asked Questions". Byrne Robotics. Retrieved July 2, 2011.</ref> Regardless, Peter David's position is that Michelinie is the sole creator, since the idea of creating a ''separate'' character using the alien symbiote was Michelinie's, as was Eddie Brock's backstory, and that without the idea to create such a character, the character would not have existed.<ref name=PeterDavid/>

In an interview with Tom DeFalco, McFarlane states that Michelinie did indeed come up with the idea of Venom and the character's basic design ("a big guy in the black costume"). However, he contends that it was he (McFarlane) who gave Venom his monster-like features. He claims; "I just wanted to make him kooky and creepy, and not just some guy in a black suit."<ref>''Comics Creators on Spider-Man'', pg 148, Tom DeFalco. (Titan Books, 2004)</ref>

This dispute arose at a time when the merits of artists as collaborators and writers were being debated in the industry, a discussion prompted by the popularity of artists such as McFarlane, Larsen, and other founders of [[Image Comics]].<ref>Wallace, Dave (February 10, 2007).

Venom's existence was first indicated in ''Web of Spider-Man'' #18 (Sept. 1986), when he shoves [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] in front of a subway train without Parker's [[spider-sense]] warning him, though only Brock's hand is seen on-panel. The next indication of Venom's existence was in ''Web of Spider-Man'' #24 (March 1987), when Parker has climbed out of a high story window to change into Spider-Man, but finds a black arm coming through the window and grabbing him, again without being warned by his spider-sense.

The character would remain unseen and inactive until ''Amazing Spider-Man'' editor [[Jim Salicrup]] required a villain for that book's 300th issue, and Michelinie suggested a villain consisting of the alien [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] grafted onto the body of a human female; seeking revenge for the deaths of her husband and miscarried baby who would accidentally die as the unfortunate result of Spider-man battling another supervillain. Salicrup accepted the suggestion, but changed the character to a male, and the female character's plot was also scrapped.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}  Michelinie then devised the Eddie Brock identity. Michelinie contends that the plots for issues #298–299, as well as the visual descriptions of the character, were written and bought by Salicrup before McFarlane was ever assigned to the book.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Cancer and post-Venom===
[[Image:Eddiebrockcancer.PNG|135px|left|thumb|Eddie Brock, separated from the symbiote, dying from cancer in ''Sensational Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #39 (August 2007).]]
The 2003 story "The Hunger" introduced new elements to Brock's origin, revealing that Brock had cancer before joining with the symbiote, and that it chose to bond with Brock not only for his hatred towards Spider-Man, but also because the cancer causes the release of adrenaline, which sustains the symbiote. Brock is left reliant on the suit to live, and pursues Spider-Man out of fear that he will take the symbiote back, rather than for revenge over his lost career.<ref name="Spectacular5"/> Brock dies after the symbiote leaves him for Spider-Man, not wanting a diseased host. Spider-Man tricks the symbiote into again bonding with Brock, reviving him.<ref name="Spectacular5"/>

In the 2004 story "Venomous", Brock experiences a crisis of faith and decides to sell the symbiote, knowing he will rapidly die from his cancer without it, intending to donate the $100 million received from the sale to charity on the grounds that the symbiote would find another host once he dies anyway.<ref name="SensationalV26"/> The symbiote is purchased by crime boss [[Don Fortunato]] for his son [[Venom (Angelo Fortunato)|Angelo Fortunato]].<ref name="SensationalV27"/> Angelo briefly becomes the second Venom but proves an unworthy host, and the symbiote abandons him mid-jump allowing him to fall to his death. Upon learning of Angelo's death, Brock feels responsible and attempts suicide by slitting his wrists.<ref name="SensationalV28"/> Brock next appeared in the 2007 story "The Last Temptation of Eddie Brock", where he is rapidly succumbing to cancer, and experiencing hallucinations of "Venom". Finding a comatose Aunt May in the same hospital, dying from a gunshot, the Venom hallucination persuades him to kill her. Brock, dressed in a novelty replica of Spider-Man's black costume at the demand of "Venom",<ref name="SensationalV238"/> murders a nurse to test if he can still kill, but ultimately refuses to kill May because she is innocent. When Peter visits May, he finds Eddie, who has repeatedly cut his own wrists to get rid of "Venom". Eddie asks for Peter's forgiveness before jumping out of a window, but Peter manages to catch him. Awakening chained to his bed, Brock finds he can still see "Venom" but tells him that he accepts its presence as long as it knows that Brock is in control.<ref name="SensationalV239"/>

===Anti-Venom===
[[Image:Antivenom.jpg|thumb|upright|Eddie Brock's first appearance as Anti-Venom]]
The 2008 story ''"[[New Ways to Die]]"'' features the return of Brock. Matt Murdock convinces a court of law that Brock is not responsible for his actions while bonded to the symbiote and has criminal charges against him dropped.<ref name="Amazing568"/> Brock gets a job at a soup kitchen under [[Mister Negative|Martin Li]]. Brock is unknowningly cured of his cancer by Li, who possesses special abilities, and Brock believes it to be a miracle.<ref name="Amazing568"/> After Brock is attacked by the new Venom, [[Mac Gargan]], the symbiote attempts to reunite with Brock. Brock's skin becomes [[Corrosive substance|caustic]] to the symbiote, and he is enveloped in a new white symbiote forged from the remnants of the Venom symbiote in his body bonding with his white blood cells charged with Li's healing energy,<ref name="Amazing568"/> becoming Anti-Venom. Brock defeats Gargan and nearly kills the Venom symbiote. When Brock detects remnants of the symbiote inside Spider-Man, he attempts to "cure" him, draining radiation from his body and nearly de-powering him.<ref name="Amazing569"/> While later saving Spider-Man from Norman Osborn, Brock again fights a battle-suit enhanced Gargan and the recovering symbiote.<ref name="Amazing572"/><ref name="Amazing573"/> Gargan hits Anti-Venom with his stinger, injecting a poisonous formula that seemingly destroys Brock's suit. When Gargan attempts to kill Brock, the Venom symbiote stops him. Brock's Anti-Venom suit later reforms.<ref name="Amazing573"/>

Brock later faces the villain [[Mister Negative]] and discovers that he and Li are the same person. Learning that the man he idolized is a supervillain causes a breakdown for Brock, making him question his faith, referring to himself as a monster.<ref name="AmazingExtra2"/>  After this revelation he becomes increasingly unstable mentally, murdering small-time criminals as he did during his "lethal protector" days. He briefly and reluctantly [[Team-up|teams up]] with the [[Punisher]] to stop a drug cartel that kidnapped a friend of Brock's.<ref>''Anti Venom: New Ways to Live''</ref> In ''"The Return of Anti-Venom"'' (2011), Brock is unable to expose Negative's true identity, believing no one will trust him. Anti-Venom starts a crusade against Negative, attacking his criminal operations.<ref name="Amazing663"/> When Anti-Venom realizes that May Parker also knows Negative's identity, he decides to attack Negative directly before Negative can silence her.<ref name="Amazing663"/> Brock teams up with Spider-Man and the new [[Wraith (Marvel Comics)#Yuri Watanabe|Wraith]] to fight Negative. Wraith uses her technology to publicly reveal Mister Negative is Martin Li, sending him into hiding. Spider-Man and Anti-Venom call a truce to their rivalry.<ref name="Amazing664"/>

In a 2011 ''New Avengers'' storyline, Brock joins [[Wonder Man]]'s [[Revengers#Earth-616|Revengers]] to destroy the New Avengers.<ref name="RevengersCBR"/> During the 2011 "[[Spider-Island]]" storyline in which 99% of New York City's population are transformed into mind-controlled spiders, Brock is forced to sacrifice the symbiote—and being Anti-Venom—so that it can be converted into a powerful curative capable of healing the infected millions.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #668</ref><ref name="Amazing670"/><ref name="Amazing671"/>

Later, a new Anti-Venom is seen in the crowd of new heroes attending a "self help" style seminar being held by Roderick Kingsley (the first Hobgoblin). All the new heroes have been given heroic personas by Kingsley that already exist but are no longer used. It is not shown whether the new Anti-Venom is indeed a symbiote or just a man in a suit designed to look like the original symbiote, however the speech bubble used for the character is stylized in a way to suggest a distortion of the characters voice similar to the way Eddie Brock spoke when he had the Anti-Venom symbiote.<ref>''AXIS: Hobgoblin'' #1 (Oct. 2014)</ref>

===Bonded to Toxin===
A powerless Brock returns in ''Venom'' [[List of Venom titles|vol. 2]] #15 (2012), where he kills the symbiotes [[Hybrid (Scott Washington)|Hybrid]] and Scream as part of a crusade to destroy the aliens entirely, believing them to be evil.<ref name="Venom15"/> After failing to kill the newest [[Flash Thompson#Agent Venom|Venom]], Brock is captured by the villain [[Crime Master#Bennett Brant|Crime Master]] and forcibly bonded with the Toxin symbiote.<ref name="Venom17"/> Brock (who is being controlled by the Toxin symbiote) then tracks down Venom and attempts to kill him, but is defeated.<ref name="Venom18"/> Eddie and Agent Venom face off once more at Crime Master's HQ, and Flash is able to subdue Toxin and separate Eddie from the symbiote using a flamethrower. Just before Flash can get Eddie out, the Toxin symbiote grabs hold of him and drags him into the flames.<ref name="Venom21"/> Eddie and the Toxin symbiote both survive the flames and track Flash to [[Philadelphia]].<ref name="Venom32"/> Now in control of the Toxin symbiote, he confronts Flash in the high school where he works as a gym teacher.<ref name="Venom22"/> After helping Flash defend the students from a group of cybernetic parasites, Eddie forms a truce with him, promising to leave Flash alone as long as he has the Venom symbiote under control (similar to the truce he had with Spider-Man). Eddie subsequently leaves Philadelphia to resume his vigilante activities.<ref>''Venom'' vol. 2 #35 (May. 2013)</ref>

===Hunting Carnage===
While fighting a drug cartel, Brock is approached by FBI agent Claire Dixon and invited to join the team she has assembled in order to hunt down and capture Cletus Kasady, which also includes [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]], and Manuela Calderon, a survivor of one of Kasady's massacres, although Brock secretly plans to kill Kasady.<ref>''Carnage'' Vol. 2 #1</ref> After Kasady's defeat, Brock gives up the Toxin symbiote.<ref>''Carnage'' Vol. 2 #15</ref>

===Return as Venom===
Eddie Brock decides to help the FBI against the new villainous Venom. With the FBI and Spider-Man, Brock is able to separate the symbiote from its new host, Lee Price. In the process, Spider-Man's actions cause the symbiote to rekindle its previous hatred for him. Brock then breaks the symbiote out of custody and bonds with it again.<ref>''Venom'' Vol. 3 #6</ref> After stopping a robbery, Brock encounters Scorpion and manages to defeat him, until the symbiote takes him to a church and reveals that it attacked the priest. After finding out about a monster attack, Brock encounters a dinosaur at the church and discovers it belongs to [[Alchemax]]. While talking to Alchemax's CEO [[Liz Allan]], he learns that the mastermind is [[Stegron|Stegron the Dinosaur Man]]. Brock then finds his lair, but is spotted and captured by Stegron's dinosaurs.<ref>''Venom'' #150-151</ref> Venom found that remnants of Stegron's Dinosaur People experiments were living in the sewers, and he had to defend them from Kraven the Hunter, Shriek, and the NYPD. With help from Tana of the Dinosaur People, Venom states to the NYPD that the Dinosaur People were surviving in the sewers and that they weren't killing anyone. Upon hearing this, the NYPD arrest Kraven the Hunter and Shriek with the police captain stating that he'll have a lot of paperwork to file on this.<ref>''Venom'' #156-158</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
{{Main|Symbiote (comics)}}
Brock is a human and has no superhuman powers without the Symbiote. Prior to joining with the Symbiote, he possesses olympic-level strength from engaging in repeated, significant weight-training exercise.<ref name="Amazing300"/><ref name="LethalProtector4"/> After separating from the Symbiote and suffering from cancer, Brock loses much of his physical muscle and possesses the strength of an average human.<ref name="AvengersAnnual1"/><ref name="SensationalV238"/> Brock's cancer is cured in the 2008 story "New Ways to Die", and he is later shown with a restored large physique.<ref name="NewWaysToLive1"/> He is also shown to be proficient in combat and capable of using specialized weaponry to defeat symbiote-empowered enemies.<ref>''Venom'' #15 and #17. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===As Venom===
As Venom, Brock gains several abilities similar to those of Spider-Man, the Symbiote's former host, including superhuman strength, speed, agility and reflexes as well as the ability to adhere to most surfaces with his hands and feet. The Symbiote is also able to project a web-like substance from its body, similar to Spider-Man's. However, this webbing is produced organically by the Symbiote from its own mass, which means that overuse can weaken the alien until it is able to regenerate.<ref name="Amazing300"/>  The Symbiote can also send out tendrils which can be used to grab or manipulate items from a distance.<ref name="Amazing333"/> When bonded with the host, the Symbiote allows the host to bypass Spider-Man's spider-sense, preventing the hero from sensing attacks. The Symbiote is susceptible to harm from high-pitched sonic frequencies which can cause it to be severely weakened or killed. The bond between the Symbiote and Brock was strong enough that using sonics against the Symbiote could also stun and kill Brock.<ref name="Amazing300"/>

Venom's body is highly resistant to injury, capable of outright stopping bladed weapons,<ref name="AmazingAnnual25"/> bullets,<ref name="Amazing333"/> and it can help its host survive in hostile environments by filtering air, allowing survival underwater<ref name="Amazing347"/> and in toxic environments. Venom can also morph his appearance, to create disguises at will,<ref name="Amazing300"/><ref name="Amazing333"/> and camouflage itself,<ref name="LethalProtector3"/> even emulating water.<ref name="Amazing347"/>  It is also capable of psychically detecting its offspring; however, this ability can be blocked.<ref name="Amazing362"/>  This sense can be used by Brock even when separated from the suit, allowing him to detect and be detected by the Symbiote and its children.<ref name="Separation2"/><ref name="Separation3"/>  The Symbiote is capable of healing injury and illness at an increased rate, allowing the host to survive otherwise mortal damage.<ref name="Sinner2"/> The Symbiote and host are capable of sharing knowledge, the Symbiote able to pass on information from previous hosts to future ones.<ref name="SensationalV27"/>

===As Anti-Venom===
Anti-Venom is created when the healing energies of Martin Li cause Brock's white-blood cells and traces of the Venom Symbiote still within his body to combine into a new suit composed of human/alien hybrid antibodies possessing powerful restorative abilities.<ref name="Amazing568"/><ref name="Amazing572"/>  Brock is capable of rapidly healing significant injury as Anti-Venom, recovering almost instantly after being shot in the head and suffering damage to his brain.<ref name="Amazing664"/><ref name="AntiVenomNewWaystoLive"/>  However, this healing ability can be negated by the energy of Mr. Negative, counteracting the energy of Martin Li.<ref name="Amazing664"/>  Anti-Venom is able to detect when others are ill<ref name="NewWaysToLive1"/> and "cure" or "cleanse" them. He is able to cure ailments from hepatitis to removing narcotics and even radiation from a person's body.<ref name="NewWaysToLive1"/><ref name="Amazing571"/>  Following a failed attempt to "cure" Spider-Man by removing the radiation in his body, Anti-Venom now automatically cancels out Spider-Man's powers whenever the two are in close proximity to one another.<ref name="Amazing663"/><ref name="Amazing571"/>

As Anti-Venom, Brock's suit is corrosive to the Venom symbiote, inflicting pain and damage on the suit to the point of causing it to dissolve.<ref name="Amazing569"/><ref name="Amazing570"/> He displays similar abilities to Venom, possessing super strength, speed,<ref name="AntiVenomNewWaystoLive3"/> negating Spider-Man's spider-sense,<ref name="Amazing570"/> and being able to block damage entirely from some guns and knives.<ref name="AntiVenomNewWaystoLive"/><ref name="AntiVenomNewWaystoLive3"/>  He is also capable of extending and morphing the suit to create disguises,<ref name="Amazing571"/> form items such as shields,<ref name="NewWaysToLive1"/> extend his reach,<ref name="Amazing663"/> attack from a distance,<ref name="AntiVenomNewWaystoLive3"/> and create tendrils.<ref name="NewWaysToLive1"/>  Anti-Venom is also immune to the weaknesses of the Venom Symbiote, showing no damage or effect from direct blasts of fire, heat and sound.<ref name="AntiVenomNewWaystoLive"/><ref name="Amazing571"/>  The only shown weaknesses of the Symbiote are a highly toxic "super venom" created as a direct countermeasure using remnants of Anti-Venom's suit, and Mr. Negative's energy.<ref name="Amazing572"/>  The "super venom" causes the suit to immediately dissolve.<ref name="Amazing573"/> Mr. Negative is shown capable of using his energy to weaken or nullify the healing abilities of the suit.<ref name="Amazing664"/>
