'''Elektro''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[robot]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. 

==Publication history==
Elektro first appeared in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #13 (Jan. 1961), in the seven-page story "Elektro" by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and [[penciler]] [[Jack Kirby]]. Elektro debuted in an issue of what fans and historians call [[Atlas Comics (1950s)#Pre-superhero Marvel|pre-superhero Marvel]] comics<!--small c correct-->, published by Marvel's 1950s and early 1960s predecessor, [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]].

==Fictional character biography==
Elektro was originally a supercomputer created by scientist Wilbur Poole. The computer, however, achieves independent thought and hypnotizes Poole, and forces him to build an immense robotic body, {{convert|60|ft|m}} tall, for protection and mobility. Calling itself Elektro and now armed with several dangerous weapons, the robot decides to conquer mankind and attacks the city of San Francisco.
Poole, however, recovers from the hypnotic trance and deactivates Elektro by accessing one of the robot's feet and removing a transistor.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #13 (Jan. 1961)</ref>

Years later, [[Mister Fantastic]] wipes Elektro's flawed programming and replaces it. He then "enrolls" Elektro in his rehabilitation program, which involves Elektro being reduced to human size and stripped of his powers so as to allow him to enter human society. Elektro takes up a job as a mail attendant in the Fantastic Four's headquarters, the [[Baxter Building]], and later joins his fellow rehab-program creatures, the [[extraterrestrials]] [[Fin Fang Foom]], [[Googam]] and [[Gorgilla]], to defeat the microscopic alien conqueror [[Tim Boo Baa]]. He also starts a relationship with Fantastic Four's robotic [[receptionist]] [[Roberta (comics)|Roberta]].<ref>''Marvel Monsters: [[Fin Fang Four]]'' #1 (Jan. 2005)</ref>

At some point, Elektro was arrested upon being mistaken for [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] and is imprisoned. Upon getting word of this, the robots at the Baxter Building saw the prison riot that Elektro was in. Elektro was later freed from prison when the confusion was cleared up.<ref>''Fin Fang Four Return'' #1</ref>
