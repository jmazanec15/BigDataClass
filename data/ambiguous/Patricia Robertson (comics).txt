'''Patricia Robertson''' is a [[fictional character]] who appears in comic books published by [[Marvel Comics]], as the second character who goes by the identity of She-Venom, after [[Ann Weying (comics)|Ann Weying]].

==Publication history==
Patricia Robertson first appeared in ''[[Venom (comic book)|Venom]]'' #1 (June [[2003 in comics|2003]]), created by writer [[Daniel Way]] and artist Francisco Herrera. As She-Venom, she first appeared in ''Venom'' #10 (March [[2004 in comics|2004]]), with a design by artist Paco Medina.

==Fictional character biography==
Patricia Robertson was a [[Telecommunication|communication]]s specialist for the [[U.S. Army]] stationed at a [[radar]] installation in [[Canada]] near the [[Arctic Circle]]. She had joined the army in order to "prove herself" but got more than she bargained for. During a routine supply run to an outpost owned by the Ararat Corporation, she stumbled upon a grisly scene: everyone at the installation was dead except for one lone scientist locked in the freezer. She brought the survivor back to base for medical attention, then people began dying there as well. It was revealed that the Ararat Corporation was run by an alien colony of miniature spider robots that infiltrated the American government. These creatures were partially led by an entity named Bob.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

These creatures had cloned Venom in order to fulfill their objective: extermination of the human race. The clone would burn out its hosts' life, unlike the real Venom (traits which seem to be a throwback to the invading [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiotes]] seen in ''[[Planet of the Symbiotes]]''). Bob had the clone released and it caused the slaughter of the outpost.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

The Venom clone hitched a ride on the survivor back to base, despite the best efforts of Robertson and her new ally. The mysterious [[Suit (comic)|Suit]] was made of the same robots as Bob, which was revealed to have been unwittingly brought to Earth by [[Reed Richards]] and made into a special agent by [[Nick Fury]]. It is unclear if the Suit's loyalties lie with Nick Fury or Bob, if either. Meanwhile, the genetically altered symbiote killed all of Patricia's friends and coworkers. While Robertson was unconscious, the Suit [[cybernetics|cybernetically]] altered her, shaving her head, attaching a metal pipe to it, and placing a control collar on her so that in case the symbiote clone bonded with her she could control it. Meanwhile, Ararat Co. and the spider-robots [[nuclear warfare|nuked]] Voici, Canada leaving the symbiote with few options. After the Suit sabotaged the symbiote's favored host, [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], it was forced to jump to the last surviving potential host, Robertson.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

One of Bob's agents, disguised as the [[Suit (comic)|Suit]], told Robertson that she had to kill the real Venom or the symbiotes would destroy all of humanity. Attempting to get to Venom, she freed him from [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody. Their first fight was broken up by the real Suit, and the electrocuted Venom retreated. The Suit chided Robertson for coming to New York due to there being many people in the city and all of the population could be in danger if the symbiote clone jumped hosts.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Meanwhile, Bob remotely deactivated Patricia's control collar so that nothing restrained the symbiote but Patricia's willpower. Robertson continued trying to kill Venom, beating up [[Spider-Man]] when he got in the way. She was captured by the [[Fantastic Four]], who used her as bait to lure Venom into a trap. Unfortunately, Spider-Man's interference and the strength and craftiness of Venom caused the trap to fail. Fighting again, Venom absorbed Robertsonâ€™s symbiote clone, as Bob hoped, and increased in size and decided to carry out the Ararat Corporation's goals.{{issue|date=December 2012}} Patricia's fate is uncertain, and the clone was later regurgitated by the symbiote onto [[Flash Thompson]]'s neighbor Andi Benton, creating Mania.
