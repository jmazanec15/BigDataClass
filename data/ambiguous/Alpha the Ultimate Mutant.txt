'''Alpha the Ultimate Mutant''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
Alpha the Ultimate Mutant first appeared in ''[[The Defenders (comic book)|The Defenders]]'' #15–16 (September–October 1974), and was created by [[Len Wein]] and [[Sal Buscema]].

The character subsequently appears in ''[[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]]'' #14–15 (September–October 1990).

Alpha the Ultimate Mutant received an entry in the ''All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A–Z'' #1 (2006).

==Fictional character biography==
Alpha is a being artificially created by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], a prominent [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] in the [[Marvel Universe]].

Following an epic battle with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]],<ref>''Avengers'' #11</ref> Magneto is imprisoned in the center of Earth. Magneto manages to escape and propels himself towards the surface.<ref>''Defenders'' #15</ref> On the way, he finds the underground ruins of a long-lost technologically advanced civilization in [[New Mexico]]. Using the machinery and books he finds among the ruins, he began bio-engineering "the ultimate mutant".

[[Professor X]] [[telepathy|telepathically]] detects that Magneto and the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] are active in the area of the [[Carlsbad Caverns]], and he summons the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] to launch an attack against them. Magneto and the Brotherhood manage to repel the Defenders for enough time to allow the engineering of Alpha to be completed.

Alpha emerges as an oversized humanoid of subhuman intelligence (he was characterized as "neolithic"<ref>''Defenders'' #16</ref>). Initially he is only capable of creating [[Force field (science fiction)|force fields]] as a reflex, and of blindly following Magneto's orders. However, each time he uses his powers, Alpha's cranium widens, causing an increase to his intellect.

Magneto has Alpha teleport him and the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants to the [[United Nations headquarters]].<ref name="mnyc">{{cite book | last = Sanderson | first = Peter | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | year = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 49–51 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-4165-3141-6}}</ref> When his demands for world rulership are turned down, Magneto orders Alpha to [[telekinesis|telekinetically]] lift the Secretariat Building and suspend it in mid-air. After the Defenders attack the Brotherhood, Alpha was coerced by Magneto to retaliate in various means, including:

* Transforming the concrete pavement into autonomous "rock-men"
* Transforming the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] into a stone statue
* Telekinetically spinning the airborne [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk]] in the air until he lost consciousness
* Fusing the feet of [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]] to the ground

The rampant use of his powers eventually elevate Alpha's awareness to a superhuman level. Persuaded by Professor X, he telepathically probes both the Brotherhood of Mutants and the Defenders in order to discover which team was evil. Understanding that Magneto had fooled him into committing malicious acts, Alpha punishes his erstwhile allies by regressing them to infancy. He also restores the United Nations building complex and erases the event from the minds of all onlookers.

Finally, declaring himself too evolved to remain on Earth, Alpha transforms himself to a streak of light and leaves to explore the universe.

[[Quasar (Wendell Vaughn)|Quasar]] briefly glimpses Alpha, first on the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]]'s Labworld,<ref>''[[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]]'' #14</ref> and then during his journeys in the cosmos.<ref>''Quasar'' #15</ref> From what Quasar saw, Alpha seems to be paired with another highly evolved humanoid named [[Futurist (comics)|Futurist]].

==Powers and abilities==
Alpha the Ultimate Mutant possesses telepathy and vast powers enabling him to transmute the elements, reconstruct matter, reverse the aging process, project force fields, teleport himself and others, fly, and survive in the vacuum of space. He possesses telekinetic powers which are enough to lift a 50-story skyscraper and the surrounding land into the air. His powers are not without limits and are presumably weaker than those of the Stranger.

Alpha the Ultimate Mutant originally had a hulking form which likely possessed great strength but lacked enough intelligence to obey commands. Within a few hours, Alpha's cranium and brain grew in size and evolved into a being of great intellect with a form to match.

Alpha the Ultimate Mutant stands at 10 feet tall, although he can alter his form at will.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Alpha the Ultimate Mutant was seen in the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' theme where he was seen charging towards the X-Men with the mutants on Magneto's side. He later appeared in the episode "Beyond Good and Evil" Pt. 4, amongst the psychic mutants.
