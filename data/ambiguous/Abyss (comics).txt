==Fictional character biography==
===Nils Styger===
'''Nils Styger''' first appeared as a protector for [[Genosha]]n researcher Renee Majcomb whom he had been assisting with research into the [[Legacy Virus]] from which Abyss suffered.<ref>''Cable'' vol. 2, #40</ref> However, he did not die due to the actions of [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], who sacrificed himself to release an airborne cure to the virus which had taken his little sister [[Magik (comics)|Illyana]]'s life several years prior.

Abyss was later seen in Berlin, Germany battling the former [[Gene Nation]] member known as [[Fever Pitch (comics)|Fever Pitch]]. Both mutants were captured by [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]]'s mutant militia known as the [[X-Corps]].<ref name="uncannyxmen402">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Joe Casey]] | Penciller =  [[Ron Garney]] | Inker = [[Mark Morales (comics)|Mark Morales]] | Story = Utility Of Myth | Title = Uncanny X-Men | Issue = 402 |date=March 2002 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref> While being held by the X-Corps, Abyss witnessed [[Sunpyre]]'s murder.<ref name="uncannyxmen404">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Joe Casey]] | Penciller =  [[Sean Phillips]] | Inker = none | Story = Army Ants | Title = Uncanny X-Men | Issue = 404 |date=May 2002 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref> When the terrorist [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] revealed herself and her intentions to use the X-Corps, the wounded Banshee freed Abyss from his confinement. Abyss then sucked Mystique through his interdimensional void, and, unable to shut off his power, almost swallowed Banshee also. The timely arrival of some other members of X-Corps stopped that however. Abyss admitted that he had no idea where Mystique was transported to or if she would ever return.<ref name="uncannyxmen406">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Joe Casey]] | Penciller =  [[Aaron Lopresti]] | Inker = [[Mark Morales (comics)|Mark Morales]] & [[Danny Miki]] | Story = Staring Contests Are For Suckers | Title = Uncanny X-Men | Issue = 406 |date=July 2002 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref>

Abyss later resurfaced when his father [[Azazel (Marvel Comics)|Azazel]] psychically summoned his many children to attempt to release his army from the Brimstone Dimension that he had been banished to hundreds of years before. In an attempt to free himself and his comrades, Azazel had traversed the dimension barrier many times and [[father|sired]] children in the hopes that one of them would be able to breach the dimensional barrier. Abyss joined forces with the [[X-Men]] to avert Azazel's attempt to bring his army into Earth's dimension and succeeded in foiling his father's efforts. He was subsequently revealed to be [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]'s half-brother, as both were sons of Azazel.<ref name="uncannyxmen429">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Chuck Austen]] | Penciller =  [[Philip Tan (penciller)|Philip Tan]] | Inker = none | Story = The Draco Part 1 | Title = Uncanny X-Men | Issue = 429 |date=October 2003 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref>

Abyss is one of [[Decimation (comics)|scores of mutants who lost their powers]] after the events of the ''[[House of M]]'' as he was shown to be among a list of other mutants who lost their powers in New Avengers.<ref name="newavengers18">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Penciller =  [[Mike Deodato]] | Inker = [[Joe Pimentel]] | Story = The Collective Part 2 | Title = New Avengers | Issue = 18 |date=June 2006 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref>

Abyss is currently a member of the [[X-Cell]] (a group of ex-mutants who blame the government for the power-loss of mutants). He was repowered by Quicksilver. When the side effects of the Terrigen Mist began to take effect, he flung [[Fatale (comics)|Fatale]] and [[Reaper (Marvel Comics)|Reaper]] into the Brimstone Dimension and followed them.<ref>''X-Factor'' vol. 3, #20</ref>

It was later discovered that the three of them were frozen within the Brimstone Dimension. [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] scientist Dr. Terrence Hoffman later used a machine to extract Abyss, Fatale, and Reaper from the Brimstone Dimension and drained them of their energies.<ref>''All-New X-Force'' #1</ref> After the three ex-mutants were rescued and Dr. Hoffman was defeated, Abyss remained silent as Fatale and Reaper vowed to make Quicksilver pay for their near death through the Terrigen Crystals.<ref>''All-New X-Force'' #2</ref>

===Sorcerer===
The second Abyss is a [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]] who is the archenemy of the Luminals of Xarth Three (who are Xarth Three's version of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]). The Luminals have thwarted Abyss's plans many times and he always returned. In a last ditch effort to rid themselves of Abyss, the Luminals used a spell that cast Abyss to the ends of the universe. Abyss ended up sealed away in [[Knowhere]], a small city contained below the severed head of a dead [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]]. When Abyss was threatening to break out, he managed to make a crack in his prison where his magic started to turn its inhabitants into [[zombie]]s that obey his every command. A high-grade telepathic dog named [[Cosmo the Spacedog|Cosmo]] who serves as the chief of security on Knowhere ordered any survivors to get into the dimension envelope on his tab. Cosmo managed to seek out [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]] and tell him of Knowhere's plight.<ref>''Nova'' Vol. 4 #8</ref>

Cosmo tells Nova all about Abyss and what he can do. While evading Abyss' zombies, Nova and Cosmo head towards Knowhere where they find Abyss' prison slowly breaking down. While Cosmo projects a psychic barrier to block off the incoming zombies, Nova dealt with Abyss. Nova used the [[Techno-organic virus|Transmode Virus]] in his possession to interface with Abyss' prison which repaired it and sealing Abyss away once again. Once Abyss was sealed away, the zombies disintegrated and life on Knowhere returns to normal.<ref>''Nova'' Vol. 4 #9</ref>

===Marvel NOW!===
The third Abyss appeared during the events of ''[[Marvel NOW!]]''. This version is a female who is the ally of a mysterious and powerful being called [[Ex Nihilo (comics)|Ex Nihilo]] and assisted in a plot to bring a breathable atmosphere and vegetation to Mars.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 5 #1</ref>

In a prelude to the ''[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]'' storyline, Ex Nihilo, Abyss, [[Nightmask]], and [[Star Brand]] join the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 5 #17</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The first Abyss is a mutant who can unwind his body into highly tensile strands that can be stretched or used to ensnare a victim. While holding them he can absorb anything within the shadowy confines of his form, akin to what the superhero known as [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak]] does. His body is actually a portal to the same dimension that [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] temporarily enters when he teleports, later dubbed the "Brimstone Dimension" from the side-effect of Nightcrawler's powers. He is able to drain the lifeforce of the captives he holds in his form and can deposit them in this dimension permanently, but it is unknown if anything can survive there. He has limited psionic empathy, able to feel the emotions of people contained within him and those in his immediate vicinity. Artists often differ in the way that they portray Abyss (in fact his appearance has drastically changed within single story arcs, though no other character seemed to think this was odd). Sometimes Abyss will have a green face and a black body, while other times he will be blue and have a body structure similar to [[Flatman (comics)|Flatman]]. During the storyline "The Draco", Abyss appeared very similar to Nightcrawler, though he was depicted as being the age of a young teenage boy.

The second Abyss can turn anyone into [[zombie]]s that obey his every command, fire energy blasts, and summon [[ghost]]-like beings.

The third Abyss is composed of living gas and is invulnerable to harm. She also has the ability to suggest ideas and manipulate certain beings into acting the way she wants.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
Before his introduction in the mainstream Marvel universe, a variant of Abyss appeared in the alternate timeline of the "[[Age of Apocalypse]]". He was one of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]'s [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Horsemen]], a [[nihilism|nihilist]] with a warped sense of humor. This Abyss has a slightly different appearance but essentially the same powers.

Abyss was rumored to have been a prisoner of [[Mister Sinister|Sinister's]] Breeding Pens, from which he broke out. But instead of rebelling against Apocalypse, he joined his forces, attaining the rank of Horseman after killing Bastion. Abyss became attached to the religious institutions of Apocalypse's regime: the Brotherhood of Chaos and The Madri. He joined them in their attack against refugees escaping from North America and was defeated by [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]]. Seeking revenge, Abyss faced [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]] and Quicksilver at the Temple of the Madri, though Abyss died when Banshee sacrificed himself by flying inside of the Horseman's void and activating his powers.

==In other media==
===Video games===
* The main antagonist in the video game ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes]]'' goes under the name '''Abyss'''. Although the two bear no real similarities apart from the name.
* Abyss appears as one of Apocalypse's Horsemen in ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]'' voiced by [[Quinton Flynn]]. There is no mention of him being Nightcrawler's brother. He appears as one of the Horsemen of Apocalypse. During the battle, Abyss sucks the players into the Brimstone Dimension near the end.
