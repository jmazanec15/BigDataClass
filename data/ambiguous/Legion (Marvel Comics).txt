'''Legion''' ('''David Charles Haller''') is a fictional superhero appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] son of [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]] and [[Gabrielle Haller]]. Legion takes the role of an [[antihero]] who has a severe mental illness including a form of [[dissociative identity disorder]], in which each of his alternate personas controls one of his many superpowers.

The television series [[Legion (TV series)|''Legion'']] premiered on [[FX (TV channel)|FX network]] in 2017. The lead character is portrayed by [[Dan Stevens]]. The series is developed, written, directed, and produced by [[Noah Hawley]], and has received a positive critical and viewer response. The show received a season two order in October 2017; it was announced the new season would be coming out in 2018.

==Publication history==
{{expand-section|date=March 2017}}
Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Bill Sienkiewicz]], Legion made his debut in ''[[New Mutants]]'' #25 (March 1985).

In 1991 Legion was assigned to be a co-starring character in the newly revamped ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'', as a member of the eponymous superteam. However, writer [[Peter David]] was uncomfortable with this, and ultimately editor [[Bob Harras]] independently came to the conclusion that Legion should not be used in the series. David explained, "I don't mind building a story around [Legion], but working him into a group - you're really asking for a bit much from the reader. Believing that a group of people will come together to form a team is enough of a suspension of disbelief... 'Oh, by the way, one of them is so nuts he shouldn't be setting foot off [[Muir Island]]'... that's asking the reader to bend so far he will break."<ref>{{cite news | last = O'Neill | first = Patrick Daniel | date = February 1992 | title = Peter David | work = [[Comics Interview]] | issue = 105 | pages = 19–20 | publisher = [[Fictioneer Books]]|issn=1052-5548}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
[[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] met [[Gabrielle Haller]] while he was working in an [[Israel]]i psychiatric facility where she was one of his patients. Xavier was secretly using his psychic powers to ease the pain of Holocaust survivors institutionalized there. The two had an affair that resulted in the birth of their son David. Xavier was initially unaware of this, as Gabrielle never told him she was pregnant.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

When he was very young, David was among the victims of a terrorist attack, in which he was the only survivor. The trauma of the situation caused David to manifest his mutant powers, incinerating the minds of the terrorists. In the process, he absorbed the mind of the terrorist leader, Jemail Karami, into his own. Being linked to so many others at their time of death, he was rendered [[catatonia|catatonic]], and remained in the care of [[Moira MacTaggert]] at the [[Muir Island]] mutant research facility. The trauma caused David's personality to splinter, with each of the personalities controlling a different aspect of his psionic power.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

Karami struggled for years to separate his consciousness from David's. Using David's telepathic abilities, he reintegrated the multiple personalities into David's core personality. Some of the personalities resisted Karami, and two proved to be formidable opponents: Jack Wayne, a swaggering adventurer, who commands David's [[psychokinesis|telekinetic]] power, and Cyndi, a temperamental, rebellious girl who controls David's [[pyrokinesis|pyrokinetic]] power. Wayne intended to destroy Karami's consciousness to preserve his own independent existence within David's mind. Neither personality succeeds, and Karami, Wayne, and Cyndi continue as David's dominant personalities.{{issue|date=March 2013}}<ref name="marveldirectory1">{{cite web|url=http://www.marveldirectory.com/individuals/l/legion.htm|title=Legion|website=www.marveldirectory.com}}</ref>

During his time at Muir Island, David emerged from his catatonia. Soon after, David was possessed by the [[Shadow King]], who used his powers to psychically increase the amount of hatred in the world and feed on the malignant energy. During this time, the Shadow King, as David, killed the mutant [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]]. The [[X-Men]] and [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] fought the Shadow King, and as a result, David was left in a coma.<ref>[[Muir Island Saga]], involving ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #278-280 and ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' #69-70</ref>

===Legion Quest/Age of Apocalypse===
When [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] tracked down David years later to get revenge for "his" murder of Destiny, he awakened with his fractured mind healed. David had a new goal, to help his father realize his dream of human-mutant coexistence by killing [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], Xavier's greatest opponent, before he had a chance to amass power. He traveled twenty years into the past, when Xavier and Magneto were orderlies at the mental hospital. In the process, he loses his memory. Magneto then accidentally triggers his memory, causing David to go on a rampage, attacking Magneto and revealing the existence of mutants to the public decades too early. Several X-Men who were pulled back in time with him were unable to prevent him from attacking Magneto. Xavier, however, leaped into the path of the psi-knife (the focused totality of Legion's psionic powers) and was killed in Magneto's place, causing the formation of the [[Age of Apocalypse]] timeline.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Dreams Die!|journal=X-Men|date=February 1995|volume=2|series=Legion Quest|issue=41}}</ref>

Due to being trapped in the past by David's actions, [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] enlisted the aid of the new reality's X-Men to travel back in time to confront Legion again. Bishop seized Legion's psi-blade and drove it into his own chest, allowing Legion to see the future that he caused. In his last moments, David apologized for what he did. David's mother, Gabrielle Haller, described having a "maternal loss" afterward, implying she miscarried before giving birth to David.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

While David was considered deceased, some of his alternate personalities remained trapped between life and death, manifesting as spirits. When the spirits started terrorizing Israel, [[Faiza Hussain|Excalibur]] was called to stop them. After learning that the spirits were refusing death, [[Meggan]] used her empathy to calm their rage, convincing them to go "towards the light."<ref>''Excalibur (1st series)'' #121</ref>

===Return===
Sometime later, Legion is discovered alive and trapped in a concrete box by the reformed New Mutants as they are investigating a possible mutant case in [[Westcliffe, Colorado]]. After accidentally absorbing Karma and trying to protect a little girl called Marci, who is trapped within his mind as well, David, now beset with an army of split personalities, tries to take control of his body through a doll named Moira, which enables its 'holder' to gain control of David's body and use his or her powers at will. Moira has come into Marci's possession and is coveted by the other personalities, particularly the more vicious and free-wheeling ones—especially Jack Wayne, who had become the ringleader for the struggle of control over David's body and powers.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #1</ref>

After escaping his cell, David flies off to kill [[Danielle Moonstar|Dani Moonstar]].<ref>''New Mutants,'' vol. 3 #1–2.</ref> One of Legion's split personalities revealed that when Bishop used Legion's psychic blade, David and Bishop fell out of reality and descended into Limbo, the cosmic place known as "no-time". The elder Bishop would die during the passage and Legion absorbed his mind as he had done before with Jemail Karami. The psychic blade also devastated David’s mental landscape, undoing all the healing work done on his mind by Karami and Professor Xavier. Instead of four personalities, David now had thousands vying for control in his mind. (Jack Wayne at least found his way back to Legion in Limbo after leaving Jerusalem, although the fates of Karami and Cyndi have not been clarified). Legion wandered through Limbo for an untold period of time, trying to make his way back home. During his journey, his "bad" personalities would occasionally slay other beings they encountered, then absorb and enslave their minds inside of David’s, but it didn't reveal how Legion managed to return to the present timeline. When Magik is absorbed into his mind as well, she begins killing off some of the more hostile personalities, including Jack Wayne, to get to Karma and Marci. Eventually Marci leads the girls to David, who has been locked away by the other personalities. They then manage to get a hold of the doll that controls his body; Karma and Magik return to their bodies, and David is taken into the care of the X-Men.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #4</ref>

Following the aftermath of Utopia, the X-Club, along with [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and Danger are repairing David's mind by isolating the other personalities from each other, much to the delight of David. It is revealed by Karma, during a session with [[Kavita Rao]] that Marci was a little girl from Westcliffe who helped David by keeping him company when he came back from the "no-time", but one of the other personalities within Legion ended up murdering her, so Marci became permanently trapped within his mind. Before [[Karma (comics)|Karma]] and [[Magik (comics)|Magik]] left his mind, Karma killed the entity who murdered Marci using Magik's soulsword. Both lie to Kavita, saying Magik killed him. With nowhere to return to, and as the only independent and non-violent personality inside him, Marci is allowed to keep David company as a source of comfort and stability while the other personality fragments are separated and isolated from them.<ref name="New Mutants, vol. 3 #5">''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #5</ref>

===Utopia===
Legion is cared for by [[Danger (comics)|Danger]], who assesses his personalities and sedates him in the prison section of [[Asteroid M|Utopia]], along with [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]], [[Empath (comics)|Empath]], and [[Donald Pierce]].{{issue|date=March 2013}}

===Second Coming===
Legion appears in "X-Men: Second Coming" as one of the X-Men fighting [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]]'s Nimrod Sentinels. With the Nimrod army relentlessly appearing from a portal hell bent on destroying the mutants on Utopia, [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] is tasked with mobilizing his son to aid in their battle against the sentinels. This is because of the X-Men's need to employ Legion's unique powers, despite his apparent instability due to his dissociative identity disorder. Legion is airdropped into battle, employing two of his many personalities, each containing a different power.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #14</ref>

===Rise of the New Mutants===
It was revealed that [[Magik (comics)|Magik]] is the one responsible for bringing Legion back to Earth after she located and made a secret agreement with "The Legion", the God-Mutant personality and arbiter of the Age of Apocalypse. Magik would show Legion the way back to Earth in exchange for his later assistance against her nemeses, the Elder Gods. He allowed himself to be locked away in David’s mind until the time was right to repay what he owed her, leaving the rest of Haller’s personalities unaware of the true circumstances of their return.<ref>''New Mutants (3rd series)'' #21</ref>

===Age of X===
When Xavier and [[Doctor Nemesis]] attempted to treat Legion's DID, it resulted in the creation of a new personality that attempted to 'protect' Legion from this 'assault' on his mind, the new personality assuming the appearance of the deceased Moira McTaggert and using its ability to warp reality to create a new world where all Legion's personas had a body for themselves and Legion could be the hero that he always wanted to be. Unfortunately, this 'heroic' status consisted of Legion being one of the mutants responsible for generating a force wall to cut the mutants off from continuous assault and persecution from the rest of humanity, to the point that 'Moira' was creating random soldiers simply for Legion and the other mutants to kill them and create the impression that they were 'safe'. After Legacy- the alternate Rogue- was tipped off about the truth of this world, she was able to release Xavier and the other telepaths- 'Moira' having kept all telepathic mutants locked away in case they saw through her deception-, who subsequently convinced Legion to absorb 'Moira' back into himself and restore reality to its original form.<ref>X-Men: Legacy #245-248</ref>

===Lost Legions===
Legion was given a Neural Switchboard Wristband that was engineered by a collaboration of Doctor Nemesis, Madison Jeffries and Reed Richards. By keying in a number this device stimulates cells in the thalamus and neocortex, creating a one-way link between Legion's own mind and one of his sub-selves. This way Legion can utilize power sets without being overwhelmed by the personality. Later it was revealed that six of David's personas escaped with corporeal bodies when reality was shifted back to normal.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #249</ref> With the help of the X-Men, Legion began to hunt down and reabsorb all of these rogue personas, but while absorbing the last one he accidentally absorbed Rogue along and after releasing her he suffered a massive shock to his nervous system. Rogue stated that while she was inside Legion she was connected to thousands of types of powers and there are more being born all the time.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #253</ref>

===Avengers vs. X-Men===
Legion recovered at some point and was seen with his father. When the [[Phoenix (comics)|Phoenix]] approached the Earth to choose a host, it caused all the omega level telepaths to suffer great pain and Legion was one of them.{{issue|date=March 2013}} At some point, Xavier took David to Merzah the Mystic to help him control his vast powers.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

With the help of Merzah, David gains a great amount of control over his powers by constructing a prison in his mind and locking away many sub-personalities while using needled gloves to drain the persona of its power. However, when a Phoenix Force-possessed Cyclops killed Professor X, the mental shock caused Legion to lose control and free all the evil personalities. This caused the death of Merzah the Mystic and many others. Unknown to David a new persona emerges and kills another persona. One by one, the Legion personas take control of David's body and start wreaking havoc around the world. David takes his body back over and finds out that he is in China. There he is attacked by people and helped by an unknown entity who uses a dead goat to build a body for itself. However, the stranger begins to insult David's father and kill some of the people. David defeats the persona and uses its power to knock out the people and read the mind of the stranger to find it full of hate for him, his father, and mutants in general. David finds out there are two twin mutants in need of help. David decides to help them and takes control of his power once and for all.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

After finding his way to [[Japan]], Legion is ambushed and captured. David learns that the twins are not prisoners but the heirs of Logan's old enemy Ogun. Legion notes that the twins are not doing what they do willingly and convince them they have free will. Legion also admits to himself that his father wasn't perfect and just because he died doesn't mean he was, and there is no harm in trying to be better. This allows David to gain more self-confidence, which makes him mentally stronger and able to beat another persona and drain it and use its power. Legion asks the twins to accompany him in his journey and the twins accept his offer. However, the same entity that David met tricks the X-Men to make them think that Legion was going to hurt the twins, so that they attacked the location, demanding that Legion step away from the twins.

In the final issue of ''X-Men: Legacy'', Legion, reaching the full extent of his powers, decides to erase himself from existence by never being born, but there is still an aspect of himself living within Blindfold's mind.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #24</ref> 
===Trauma===
However, Legion's attempt to erase himself from existence apparently only resulted in the creation of a yet new personality known as "Lord Trauma" that presumably prevented David's plan and is now threatening to take over his mind and body by absorbing all of David's personalities and powers. In a desperate attempt to save himself, David seeks out the help of renowned young psychotherapist Hannah Jones to delve into his fractured mind and fight back this dark personality.<ref>''Legion'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
[[File:XMEN-LegionPowers.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Doctor Nemesis]], [[Blindfold (comics)|Blindfold]], and [[Professor X]] among Legion's personalities.]]
Legion is an [[Omega-level mutant]]<ref>New Mutants, vol. 3 #4</ref> who has [[dissociative identity disorder|multiple personalities]]. The first personality to manifest, Jemail, was the mind of a terrorist that David absorbed into himself. According to Karma, the only ways he can absorb other people into his mind is if he is right next to them when they die or through telepathy.<ref name="New Mutants, vol. 3 #5"/> Two others, Jack Wayne and Cyndi, have made themselves known, but it is unknown how many other personalities may exist. The manifestation of Legion's individual powers are each associated with a different personality, and each personality controls a different power. The cumulative powers of all his personalities make him one of the strongest mutants in existence.

Legion's core personality took control of his splinter personalities' powers when he traveled back in time.

Some of the powers alter the host body physically, such as [[Werewolf|lycanthropy]] or a [[Prehensility|prehensile tongue]]. According to Cannonball, this is a relatively new ability. Some of the other powers include super speed, flight, X-ray vision, heat absorption, super strength, matter animation and sonic scream. Dr. Nemesis claims that Legion instinctively created a doll named Moira; when one personality gains control of the doll, it controls the body.<ref>''New Mutants,'' vol. 3 #1–5</ref> Using the soulsword given to her by Magik, Karma went inside Legion's psyche and liberated an unknown personality imprisoned deep within him. This persona turned out to be Legion himself, displaying a different behavior and appearance, marked by his peculiar eyebrows. This "true Legion" persona could warp reality and wiped the Elder Gods from existence, later resetting the universe to a state before the Elder Gods first appeared on Earth.

After the Age of X has ended, David was given a Neural Switchboard Wristband which was engineered by a collaboration of Doctor Nemesis, Madison Jeffries, and Reed Richards. By keying in a number, this device stimulates cells in the thalamus and neocortex, creating a one-way link between Legion's own mind and one of his sub-selves. This allows Legion to utilize power sets without being overwhelmed by the personality.

In the current ''X-Men: Legacy'' volume, David was shown to have greater control over his powers, but lost this control due to the mental shock of his father's death. New sub-personas were shown with powers of their own.

==Mentality==
Legion has been described as having [[dissociative identity disorder|multiple personality disorder]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://marvel.com/universe/Professor_X |title=Professor X |work=Marvel.com |accessdate=2017-07-07 }}</ref>

===Origin of name===
Legion is named<ref name="marveldirectory1"/> after the Biblical demon [[Legion (demon)|Legion]]. A man possessed by many evil spirits was asked by [[Jesus]] what his name was, to which he replied "I am Legion, for we are many."

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Marvel===
The [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate]] incarnation of [[Proteus (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Proteus|Proteus]] is a combination of Legion and Proteus from the mainstream comics. His mother is [[Moira MacTaggert]] and his father is Charles Xavier. He possesses Proteus' reality warping power and is named '''David Xavier'''. He escapes his mother's [[Muir Island|facility]], looking for his father, and murders hundreds to discredit him. David is later crushed by [[Alternate versions of Colossus#Ultimate Colossus|Colossus]], while possessing [[S.T.R.I.K.E.]] agent [[Betsy Braddock]] inside a car.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #15-19 (2002)</ref>

===Age of X===
[[File:AgeofX-ForceWarriors.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Force Warriors. Alternate versions of [[Unuscione]], [[Hellion (comics)|Hellion]], [[Rachel Summers]], Legion, and [[Psylocke]]]]
In the ''[[Age of X]]'' reality, Legion is a member of the Force Warriors, a select group of telekinetics who rebuild the "Force Walls" (telekinetic shields that protect Fortress X) on a daily basis. Unlike his 616 counterpart, there is no trace of the other personalities shown. When Magneto reveals that he too has questions regarding the origin of Fortress X, Legion and the Force Warriors arrive and relieve him of his command. It is then revealed that the Age of X was in some small way created by Legion himself. A flashback reveals that in the 616 universe Professor X was arguing with [[Dr. Nemesis]] regarding the latter's containment and deletion of Legion's other personalities in an effort to stabilize him. While Dr. Nemesis claimed that everything was going according to his plan, Professor X was unconvinced and entered Legion's mind. There he found the other personalities dead and their rotting corpses left in their containment units. This surprised Dr. Nemesis who claimed that when a personality was deleted it should simply disappear. Professor X was then attacked by what he called a "psychic antibody" a natural defense against Nemesis's deleting of the personalities. The antibody then took on the face of Moria MacTaggart and claimed that it would make a world where Legion could be happy. Professor X tried to warn Nemesis about the antibody's power but was unable to. The antibody then reshaped Utopia into Fortress X and inserted itself as Moria and the supercomputer X. Before Legion or Professor X could get any answers out of "Moria" made the Force Walls fell so the human armies began their attack and tried to destroy the universe in the box with the intended to recreate a new safe place for Legion to live happily forever. David absorbed her, taking her powers to revert the Fortress X to the normal reality, with a few modifications though.<ref>''New Mutants'' (Vol. 3) #24</ref>

====Animation====
* Legion appears in the ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'' episode "Sins of the Son" voiced by [[Kyle Labine]]. Legion's backstory remains mostly unchanged, although David Haller is a fairly normal boy with no visible mutant powers. In the episode, David appears to be kidnapped by a Scottish [[punk subculture|punk]] named Lucas, but in reality Lucas and David are one and the same. David's body can somehow change to match whichever of his multiple personalities is dominant, with personality and body shifts sometimes happening at random. The mechanism behind this ability is never fully explained, although it is possible that David is using strong psionic abilities to alter people's perception of his appearance rather than actually changing as [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]] had done when first trying to avoid being discovered. His personalities sometimes appeared in two places at once, supporting the control-of-perception theory. Only three personalities were shown. As David has no obvious powers of his own, Lucas possesses telepathic and telekinetic powers, as well as pyrokinetics while Ian, the third personality, is a young mute boy who is also a pyrokinetic. As Lucas is shown capable of both telepathic and pyrokinetic powers, it is possible the Lucas persona may have access to the powers of other personalities (if any beyond these three exist). Lucas lured Professor Xavier to Scotland and tricked him into locking David's other personalities away, leaving Lucas free to be himself. It was never explained what Lucas's goals were after this. The show has stopped production before his storyline could be further explored.
* Legion is mentioned in ''[[Marvel Anime|Marvel Anime: X-Men]]''. He is the root cause of something called "Damon-Hall Syndrome". This condition affects mutants that develop a secondary mutation causing multiple personalities, uncontrolled physical mutation, and psychological instability. There is a vaccine which Beast created to stop its progress. It should also be mentioned that one of the main antagonists of the series named '''Takeo Sasaki''' (voiced by [[Atsushi Abe]] in the Japanese version and by [[Steve Staley]] in the English Dub) is the son of Professor X and [[Moira MacTaggert|Yui Sasaki]] (a scientist in mutant research). This character is similar to Legion in many ways except for design and name, and is also similar to [[Proteus (Marvel Comics)|Proteus]] in terms of his reality-warping powers. He attended his mother's school for mutants where he was a classmate of [[Armor (comics)|Hisako Ichiki]] and an incident with Takeo being picked on by the other children resulted in a fire that burned the nearby neighborhood and had included a small burn on Hisako's hand. [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]] planned to use a near-comatose Takeo to warp reality so that the mutants can rule the world. Takeo's powers go out of control enough for him to kill Mastermind and for the entire facility he was in to collapse as he emerges as a colossal energy being. Learning that Takeo hates him for being born into a world where his powers cause him so much suffering, Professor X blames himself for causing Takeo pain. The X-Men try to attack Takeo, but are easily defeated. Professor X then prepares to destroy Takeo's mind and kill him, fully intending to die along with his son. Jean's presence manages to revive the X-Men and give them courage to fight on against. Hisako recalls her friendly past with Takeo and insists that Takeo is a good person who can be saved. Her feelings cause her armor to generate a brilliant light, reaching Takeo and bringing him back to his senses. He and Charles are able to reconcile and Takeo's body is destroyed. Before his death, Takeo is able to reassure Yui and Charles that he is all right.
