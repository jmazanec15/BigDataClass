'''Anne Weying''' is a [[fictional character]] who appears in comic books published by [[Marvel Comics]], as the first character who goes by the identity of '''She-Venom''', before [[Patricia Robertson (comics)|Patricia Robertson]].

[[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]] will portray the character in ''[[Venom (2018 film)|Venom]]'' set to be released in 2018.

==Publication history==
Anne Weying first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #375 (March [[1993 in comics|1993]]), created by writer [[David Michelinie]] and artist [[Mark Bagley]].

She-Venom first made a cameo appearance in ''[[Venom: Sinner Takes All]]'' #2 (September [[1995 in comics|1995]]). Her first full appearance was in ''Venom: Sinner Takes All'' #3 (October 1995), created by writer [[Larry Hama]] and artist Greg Luzniak.

==Fictional character biography==
Ann Weying was Eddie Brock's ex-wife, a successful [[lawyer]]. In Ann Weying's first appearance, she is a brunette with glasses. In later appearances she loses the glasses and goes blonde. Weying assisted Spider-Man by sharing some of Eddie's history with him. Later, she followed Spider-Man to the amusement park where [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] had Peter's (fake) parents. She confronted her insane ex-husband, and managed to convince Eddie to give up his [[Feud|vendetta]]. Later, [[Sin-Eater (comics)|Sin-Eater]] shot Ann, who became She-Venom when the symbiote temporarily bonded with her to save her life.<ref>''Venom: Sinner Takes All'' #2</ref>

She-Venom then lashed out against the men who had hurt her with such [[violence]] that Eddie became afraid for her (and of her) and compelled the symbiote back to him. Ann retched upon seeing the pile of bodies she had left behind. She claimed that the symbiote made her kill them, but Eddie told her that the symbiote wouldn't force its host to do something they did not want to.<ref>''Venom: Sinner Takes All'' #3</ref> Later the police incarcerated Ann on a false charge (unrelated to Ann's rampage above) in order to trap Venom. Ann used her one phone call to warn Eddie and make him promise not to come. He promised that Eddie Brock wouldn't come to save her and instead sent his Other (the symbiote) through the phone lines to her.<ref>''Venom: Along Came A Spider'' #2</ref> After it bonded with her she was able to break herself out of prison, heading to the amusement park where she and Spider-Man had confronted Venom, only to intercept a raid on a gang of drug dealers.<ref>''Venom: Along Came A Spider'' #3</ref> During the fight, Eddie was badly injured by a flamethrower, prompting Anne to release the symbiote to heal him, but left him in disgust at his dependence on the symbiote.<ref>''Venom: Along Came A Spider'' #4</ref>

Ann Weying committed [[suicide]] after spotting Spider-Man webslinging in an older black costume at a time when his regular red and blue suit had been stolen. Ann, still reeling from the experience of bonding with the symbiote months earlier and unable to deal with the return of Eddie Brock into her life—coupled with Brock's transformation into Venom directly in front of her as he ran off to kill Spider-Man—sent her over the edge, and she leapt from her high rise apartment to her death.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #19</ref> Her death is later confirmed when her tombstone is shown.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #22 (October 2000)</ref>
