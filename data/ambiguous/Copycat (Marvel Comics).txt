'''Copycat''' ('''Vanessa Geraldine Carlysle''') is a [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. She is a former member of [[X-Force]].

Actress [[Morena Baccarin]] portrays Vanessa Carlysle in the 2016 feature film ''[[Deadpool (film)|Deadpool]]''.

==Publication history==
Copycat first appeared in ''[[X-Force]]'' #19 where the character was [[retconned]] to the first appearance of [[Domino (comics)|Domino]] in ''[[The New Mutants]]'' #98 and was created by [[Fabian Nicieza]] and [[Rob Liefeld]].

==Fictional character biography==
As a young [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] shape-shifter, Vanessa Carlysle fell into a life of prostitution in [[Boston]] where she met and fell in love with a mercenary named [[Deadpool|Wade Wilson]]. Carlysle was soon saved from Wilson's vengeful employers by Zoe Culloden, a time-traveling agent of [[Landau, Luckman & Lake]] who had journeyed into the past to prevent Wilson's eventual self-destruction. That night, Wilson broke up with Carlysle after learning he had cancer, leaving her heartbroken. Carlysle became a mercenary herself, eventually employed by arms dealer [[Genesis (Marvel Comics)|Tolliver]].

Under his orders, Copycat infiltrated [[X-Force]] in the shape of [[Domino (comics)|Domino]], while she was a prisoner. Her mission was to blow up X-Force's headquarters in order to kill [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], but she became attached to the team members, fell for Cable and didn't go through with her mission. Tolliver sent Deadpool to force her to set the bomb. Deadpool would put in her place, if she refused. Deadpool revealed Copycat's cover to X-Force, and left them for dead by blowing up the complex (without knowing that X-Force had already escaped).

Vanessa briefly hid herself under the false identity (as a twin) of one of her friends; Tina Valentino. Deadpool and his associate, Sluggo, believing they killed her, killed Tina instead. She then moved in with [[Garrison Kane]] in [[San Francisco]], until Cable found them.<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = Cable|Issue = 37|Date = Nov. 1996|Publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref> She was subsequently captured by the emotion-manipulating [[Psycho-Man]], who sought Kane's advanced technology, but was rescued from the [[Microverse]] by Kane, Cable, Domino and the Microverse's resident heroes, the Microns. Later, she broke up with Kane and came back to live with Deadpool. Deadpool's feelings towards [[Siryn]] grew, so she left him after having taken his appearance to attack her, in hopes of souring their potential relationship.

Some time later, Copycat was captured by [[Weapon X]]. The treatments of Weapon X destroyed her memory and she forgot her mission. Recruited by [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], Deadpool received an order to kill her. He tried to warn her, so Weapon X sent Kane to kill the both of them.  The fight took them to a local zoo where Deadpool left her in a shapechanged gorilla form among other gorillas to fight against Kane.  When he returned the other gorillas were dead and Copycat was dying from wounds inflicted by Sabretooth.  She died shortly after in Deadpool's arms.<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = Deadpool|Volume = 1|Issue = 59|Date = Dec. 2001|Publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref>

However, Deadpool had poured an amount of his blood in Copycat's wounds, which unknown to him healed her. Vanessa then took up the identity of an owner of a chimichanga stand, and later cheated Deadpool out of one of his past marriages.<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = Deadpool|Volume = 3|Issue = 27|Date = 2014|Publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref>

== Powers and abilities==
Copycat is such a powerful and precise [[shapeshifting|metamorph]] that she can duplicate another being down to the cellular level. Because of this she is able to replicate superhuman powers, abilities, and even mental imprints so closely that telepaths have trouble identifying her. Copycat simply requires knowledge to duplicate someone's appearance, but needs physical contact to duplicate anything else. She is also capable of turning into animals, finding these forms easier to maintain than human shape.<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = Deadpool|Volume = 1|Issue = 59|Date = Dec. 2001|Publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref> Weapon X modified her powers by accelerating the rate at which she could duplicate others. However, as a side effect of this enhancement, Copycat began to lose her memory and was unable to hold any solid form for long periods of time.

===Age of Apocalypse===

In the ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'' reality, Copycat was a member of the Brotherhood of Chaos, an elite religious group affiliated to the Church of the [[Multiple Man|Madri]]. She served alongside other members such as [[Madison Jeffries]] and [[Spyne]]. She was often referred to as Sister Vanessa or Sister Carlysle. Using her shape-shifting powers, Copycat was able to hide incognito amongst the humans who had hoped to flee North America and was able to discover the site of the Sentinel Evacuation while in their midst. Vanessa led the Brotherhood to emigration site in Maine and there they clashed with the Amazing X-Men. In an attempt to elude the X-Man Quicksilver, Copycat posed as Scarlet Witch, but was forced to revert to her normal self by Dazzler. Both Copycat and Box were able to escape the X-Men and conceal themselves, posing as humans, and escaped to Europe. They were discovered at a checkpoint and provided a distraction for a group of Altered Humans to pass through, but were subsequently hunted down by Weapon X and Jean Grey, with the latter slaying Vanessa in the process.<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = Weapon X|Volume = 1|Issue = 2|Date = Apr. 1995|Publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref>

===Age of X===
In the ''[[Age of X]]'' reality, Copycat infiltrated Cannonball's X-Force when she worked for the Human Coalition. She was unmasked and killed by Husk.<ref>http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=30306</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* Copycat appeared in the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' episode "Sanctuary". She is among the mutants on [[Asteroid M]]. Copycat later appears in "Secrets Not Long Buried" where she is one of the many residents of the mutant-dominated community of Skull Mesa.

===Film===
* Vanessa Carlysle appears in ''[[Deadpool (film)|Deadpool]]'', portrayed by [[Morena Baccarin]].  Though she sports a telltale streak of white hair and references are made to the "roles" she has played, Vanessa has not demonstrated any mutant powers as of yet that relate to her comic book counterpart. She is in a relationship with [[Deadpool|Wade Wilson]] to the point of engagement prior to him becoming Deadpool. Because of his transformation, Deadpool stopped seeing Vanessa, as he's afraid of her reaction to his hideous mutation. Later on while working at a [[strip club]], Vanessa is abducted in the alley by [[Ajax (comics)|Ajax]] and [[Angel Dust (comics)|Angel Dust]] in order to lure Deadpool to a decommissioned [[Helicarrier]]. At first upon being rescued by Deadpool following Ajax's death, Vanessa was angry at him for abandoning her. After learning about his plight, Vanessa reconciles with Deadpool.
* Baccarin will reprise the role in the upcoming ''[[Deadpool 2]]''.
