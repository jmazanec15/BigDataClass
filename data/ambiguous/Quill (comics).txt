Quill is one of the Warpies, a group of superhumans created by the [[Jaspers' Warp]]. Quill and his fellow Warpies were taken in by the British government organization, the Resources Control Executive (the [[R.C.X.]]).

Quill was their leader and they attacked Captain Britain, but were later taken in by him and his sister [[Psylocke|Elizabeth Braddock]].<ref>''Captain Britain'', vol. 2 #7–9</ref> 

The Warpies were later abducted by the new R.C.X. and again came into conflict with Captain Britain, who was now part of [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]. The Warpies were all slowly turning into humans, but the new R.C.X. had told them that they were dying. Excalibur uncovered the truth and told the Warpies. They also freed the original leaders of the R.C.X. and left the Warpies in their care.<ref>''Excalibur'', vol. 1 #61–65</ref>

The Warpies were again abducted shortly afterwards by [[Black Air]], another government organisation. Black Air experimented upon the Warpies in an attempt to keep them superhuman. Their experiments succeeded, but the Warpies were saved by [[Mastermind (computer)|Mastermind]] who made them his soldiers. Quill was one of his most loyal soldiers. Under Mastermind's leadership, the Warpies attacked and destroyed most of the [[Captain Britain Corps]]. They were defeated by [[Captain Britain]], who then used his new powers to turn the Warpies, including Quill, into regular humans.<ref>''Excalibur: Sword of Power'' #1–4</ref>
