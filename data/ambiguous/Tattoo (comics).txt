'''Tattoo''', later '''Longstrike''', is a fictional [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] character in the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe. Her first appearance was in New X-Men #126, created by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Frank Quitely]].

==Fictional character biography==
A student of the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]], the young girl called Tattoo can display messages or designs on her skin, as well as phase through matter. She is one of the many students who were mentally controlled by [[Cassandra Nova]] to attack [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and [[Beast (comics)|Beast]]. Tattoo and the other students are freed from Cassandra's influence by the [[Stepford Cuckoos]]. While attending classes, Tattoo became romantically involved with a telepath named [[Slick (comics)|Slick]]. When [[Quentin Quire]] reveals Slick's true form, that of a dwarf-like creature, Tattoo is repulsed and breaks up with him. Tattoo joins the Omega Gang, led by Quentin Quire, taking up their own beliefs in mutant rights. This gang includes Tattoo's brother [[Phaser (comics)|Radian]], who can emit disorienting flashes of light. They set out to avenge what seems to be the murder of Jumbo Carnation, a popular mutant clothes designer. They also attack and kill a group of murderous, mutant-hunting [[U-Men (comics)|U-Men]].{{issue|date=December 2012}}

The Omega Gang starts a riot at Xavier Institute during 'Opening Day' celebrations, an event designed to bring the public to Xavier's. Several members, including Tattoo, confront the X-Men on the front lawn. During the battle Tattoo manages to phase her hand into [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]]'s head. She informs him if she became solid, he would die. Emma Frost turns into her diamond form and places her hand inside of Tattoo's head; now Tattoo would also die if she became solid. This eliminates the stand-off.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

After the Omega Gang is neutralized, all but Quire are sentenced to a human jail. As informed by Wolverine, once their sentences are completed, the gang members would be sent overseas to do exhausting, demanding charity work.<ref>''New X-Men'' #138</ref>

Tattoo is one of many mutants that lose their superhuman powers after [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].<ref>''New Avengers'' #18</ref>

She appears to have been let out of jail, and then decided to pay her debt in another way: by joining the newest incarnation of the [[New Warriors]].  After being given a version of [[Stilt-Man]]'s armor, she takes up the codename Longstrike, and begins training with the team. The new group includes her brother Radian. However, on one of the team's first missions out to stop the [[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac]], she is overconfident when fighting Cancer, and she is killed in front of the rest of the team.<ref>''New Warriors'' Vol. 4 #4</ref>

Her brother is saddened by her loss, but when his teammates assure him that it was her own fault that she died, he stays with the team.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

==Powers and abilities==
After taking up Stilt-Man's armor, she was able to extend her limbs to great lengths with heightened strength.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

She formerly had chameleon skin which allowed her to form words and/or patterns on her flesh; her bio-phasing ability disrupted the neurochemistry of people she reached into.
