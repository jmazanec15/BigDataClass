===Publication history===
{{expand section|date=November 2014}}
Ajax first appeared in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|Incredible Hulk]]'' vol. 2, #379 (March 1991), and was created by [[Peter David]] and [[Dale Keown]].

===Fictional character biography===
Ajax is a member of the [[Pantheon (Marvel Comics)|Pantheon]], and is one of the descendants of the immortal [[Agamemnon (comics)|Agamemnon]], along with Achilles, Atalanta, Cassiopeia, Delphi, Hector, Paris, Perseus, Prometheus, and Ulysses. Ajax was born in Texas. He was named after [[Ajax (mythology)|Ajax]], a Greek warrior who fought in the [[Trojan War]].{{issue|date=February 2016}}

When the warriors of the Pantheon first encounter the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], for the purpose of inviting him to join them, Ajax attacks the Hulk after he believes the Hulk has struck Atalanta, for whom Ajax bears an unrequited crush. To prevent injuries to nearby civilians, Hulk pretends to be rendered unconscious so that the Pantheon will take him captive.<ref>[[David, Peter]] (w), [[Keown, Dale]] (w).

Ajax serves on many of the Pantheon's missions while the Hulk is part of the team.

When he discovered Atalanta and Achilles in a romantic interlude, Ajax flies into a jealous rage, threatening to hurt both of them. He is eventually restrained and calmed by the Hulk.<ref>David, Peter (w), [[Frank, Gary]] (p), Smith, Cam (i). ''Incredible Hulk'' #405. Marvel Comics</ref>

===Powers and abilities===
Ajax is so massive that he cannot move quickly without a special [[Powered exoskeleton|exoskeleton]] battle-suit, which grants him superhuman strength, durability and reflexes. His strength increases as his anger builds, much like that of the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]].  Like other members of the Pantheon, Ajax has a fast healing ability and an extended lifespan. Without support from his battle-suit, Ajax's legs and spine would collapse under his tremendous weight. His body is disproportionate in shape. He also has poor vision.

===Personality===
He has the mentality of a young child, making him sometimes difficult to control. [[Atalanta (Pantheon)|Atalanta]] has always been able to calm him down, as he idolizes her and will do anything she says. Of course, this sometimes leads to other problems. For a time, he did not understand the difference between romantic love and platonic friendship love and this drove him into a rampage, where he even threatened Atalanta herself. The rampage was ended before anyone was seriously hurt (in Pantheon terms) or killed. Ajax took his rage out on an inanimate mountain, not realizing he was endangering himself as well. The Hulk managed to talk him into calming down.

The Hulk has also gotten into trouble when he fails to treat Ajax with the proper mind frame. At first he attacks Ajax again when he mistakes a simple hug for another threat against Atalanta. Then the Hulk let it slip that Bambi's mother had died, distressing Ajax who had been told, by Atalanta, she had run away and come back after the movie had ended.

Ajax ('''Francis''' "'''Fanny'''" '''Freeman''') first appeared in ''[[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]]''  #14 ([[cover-dated]] March, 1998) and was created by artist/writer [[Joe Kelly (comics)|Joe Kelly]] and writer [[Walter McDaniel]].

===Fictional character biography===
The man known as "The Attending" was the former enforcer at [[Dr. Killebrew]]'s laboratory, known as the Workshop, part of the Hospice for failed supersoldiers at the [[Weapon X]] Project. Francis acted as the strongarm for Killebrew, reining in the project's "washouts" that were fodder for Killebrew's sadistic experiments whenever they stepped out of line. This included Wade Wilson, who would later be known as the mercenary [[Deadpool]].<ref name="DeadpoolAnnual98">{{Cite comic

Having had his nerves removed by Killebrew for better pain management, Francis would later have enhanced strength and intuitive capability, as well as receiving subcutaneous implants for super-speed and agility.<ref name="DeadpoolAnnual98" />

After endless taunting from Wilson, Francis was given permission by Killebrew to kill him. Francis orchestrated events so that Wilson would perform a mercy killing on another inmate, which was against the rules; the inmate Deadpool was to kill was one to whom he had grown particularly close. After Francis removed Wilson's heart, his healing factor manifested itself for the first time by regenerating a new heart for the mercenary. However, the entire series of events cost him his sanity. Taking the codename Deadpool, he hunted down and seemingly killed Francis.<ref name="DeadpoolAnnual98" />

Revealed to have survived, Francis resurfaced years later using the codename of Ajax. He hunted down and killed many of the surviving members of the Weapon X project to exact his revenge on Deadpool. Ajax tortured Killebrew at his mountain home in the Alps in order to obtain Wade's teleporter frequency; after which he teleported Wade next to a nearby cliff and sucker-punched him, sending Deadpool to his apparent death.<ref name="DeadpoolAnnual98" />

In a near death experience, however, it was revealed that because Wade came back from the dead once to kill Francis, he was now bound by honor and destiny to finish the job he began those many years ago, urged on by the ghosts of Francis' victims who had also been Wilson's friends. The battle continued as Deadpool rescued Killebrew and sought shelter at Killebrew's neighbor's house. This was owned by Ilaney Bruckner who was reluctantly dragged into the conflict when Deadpool destroyed the house to slow down Francis.<ref name="DeadpoolV1Issue18">{{Cite comic

Francis caught up with the trio and proceeded to punch Deadpool repeatedly at super-speed.

Once again catching up with the fleeing Deadpool, Ajax fell victim to a trap laid by his intended victim which resulted in his armor's circuitry being exposed. Taking advantage of this, Deadpool arranged for Ajax to plunge both of them into a lake, short-circuiting his armor and giving Deadpool the opportunity to kill him, which he did by snapping his neck.<ref name="DeadpoolV1Issue19" /> Ajax "re-appeared" years later in one of Deadpool's nightmares, more specifically on a television set.<ref name="Cable&Deadpool35">{{Cite comic

[[Blackheart]] releases Ajax from Hell in an attempt to prevent Deadpool and [[Thanos]] from meddling in his latest plot to overthrow [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]. Ajax, now calling himself '''Abyss Man''', locates and attempts to kill the pair, but the duo subdue him and turn him into a gateway to Hell with the help of [[Black Talon (comics)#Black Talon (Samuel Barone)|Black Talon]].<ref name = "DVT"/>

===Powers and abilities===
Francis has enhanced strength and intuitive capacity, as a result of genetic modifications by Doctor Killebrew. After receiving implants, he gained superhuman speed and agility. His nerves were also removed to dramatically increase his tolerance for pain.<ref name="DeadpoolAnnual98"/>

==In other media==

===Film===
The Francis version of Ajax appears in the 2016 film ''[[Deadpool (film)|Deadpool]]'', named '''Francis Freeman''', portrayed by [[Ed Skrein]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/edskrein/status/585490030870851586 |title=Ed Skrein on Twitter |author=Skrein, Ed |date=April 7, 2015 |accessdate=April 8, 2015}}</ref> According to co-writer [[Rhett Reese]], the character was selected to act as the film's villain due to his "sadistic quality and his imperviousness to pain and what that implied about him" which "lands very hard on Wade Wilson and creates the fun antagonism".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.geekgirlauthority.com/deadpool-writer-rhett-reese-talks-about-ajax-and-breaking-the-fourth-wall/|title = ''Deadpool'' Writer Rhett Reese Talks about Ajax and Breaking the Fourth Wall|last = Key|first = Matt|publisher = Geek Girl Authority|date = 21 July 2015|website = geekgirlauthority.com|accessdate = 6 January 2017}}</ref> In the film, Ajax works in an underground facility (which he was also formerly a patient in) and tortures Wade Wilson to bring out his mutant genes and be sold as a super slave. He is annoyed by Wade's constant mocking, especially when Wade discovers his real name and claims he got the name Ajax from the [[Ajax (cleaning product)|cleaning product]]. His experiments result in Wade's hideous mutation and the destruction of the facility he worked in. He is injured by Wade (now known as "Deadpool") on a freeway, and escapes when his enemy is distracted by [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] and [[Negasonic Teenage Warhead]]. He and his partner [[Angel Dust (comics)|Angel Dust]] retaliate by kidnapping Wade's girlfriend [[Vanessa Carlysle|Vanessa]]. Deadpool and the two X-Men confront Ajax and his team at a scrapyard, where Ajax loses and is killed by Wade after he reveals that he cannot fix Wade's disfigurement.
