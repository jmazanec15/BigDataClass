'''Lucia von Bardas''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. She is an enemy of [[SHIELD (comics)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]], especially [[Daisy Johnson]].

==Publication history==
Lucia von Bardas first appeared in ''[[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]'' #1 and was created by [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and [[Gabriele Dell'Otto]].

==Fictional character biography==
Lucia von Bardas is a [[Latveria]]n woman who used to teach at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]] in the United States. After [[Doctor Doom|Victor von Doom]] was deposed as the leader of Latveria, the Americans helped von Bardas get elected as that country's [[prime minister]]. She then began publicly mending the ties between the two countries.<ref>Secret War #1-5</ref>

In truth, von Bardas was secretly funding American technology-based supercriminals through the [[Tinkerer]]. The [[United Nations]] [[espionage]] agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] uncovered this, but the [[President of the United States]] did not take action, believing that relationship was relatively good and that they could simply negotiate. S.H.I.E.L.D. director [[Nick Fury]] subsequently gathered a group of superheroes consisting of the [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]], [[Captain America]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], [[Luke Cage]], [[Spider-Man]], and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], as well as superpowered S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [[Daisy Johnson]], for an undercover mission to overthrow the Latverian government and assassinate von Bardas. In Latveria, Johnson used her seismic powers to take down Castle Doom, apparently killing von Bardas.<ref>Secret War #1-5</ref>

Von Bardas survived to become a deformed [[cyborg]]. A year later she attacked Cage, leaving him in a coma, and was eventually defeated once more by Johnson.

She has recently resurfaced, having regained a far less deformed-looking body, working with the [[Red Ghost]] on a plan to use KGB super-spies placed in suspended animation to frame [[Doctor Doom]] for starting a nuclear war.<ref>''Winter Soldier'' #1-4</ref>

She later returned to Latveria to rule it and help rebuild it.<ref>Invincible Iron Man 6</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Lucia von Bardas is a cyborg whose abilities include flight and generation of a force field. Prior to this, she was a skilled diplomat. While at first her cybernetic implants were mostly external, currently she sports a more organic look, with only a cybernetic eye exposed, suggesting some degree of vision enhancements.

===Video Games===
* Lucia von Bardas appears in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2]]'' voiced by [[Lani Minella]]. As a main villain on the first mission during the ''[[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]'', she has been funding [[Tinkerer]]'s supplying of technology to supervillains. [[Nick Fury]] and the heroes (the same line-up of the comics continuity minus Daisy Johnson but including [[Iron Man]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]], [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], and the [[Fantastic Four]]) confronted her in order to get her to surrender, but her castle ends up exploding due to the heroes defeating one of Tinkerer's superpowered machines. She later attacks New York as a deformed cyborg. When the heroes (helped by [[Carol Danvers|Ms. Marvel]]) attack her on a ship, she starts to activate herself as a bomb taking [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Diamondback]], [[Scorcher (comics)|Scorcher]], [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], and [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]] along for the ride only to be defeated and deactivated by the heroes. In the PSP, Wii and PS2 versions however, she invades the New York streets directly. This eventually culminates in the superheroes following her to Times Square where she has planted a massive bomb (that has to be destroyed within 5 minutes). Upon the bomb's destruction, she collapses lamenting her failure to Latveria.
