'''Shatterstar''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].

==Publication history==
Shatterstar first appeared in ''[[Inhumans]]'' #3-6 (February-August 1976), and was created by [[Doug Moench]] and [[George Pérez]].  The character subsequently appears in ''Captain Marvel'' #53 (November 1977), and ''Avengers'' #383 (February 1995).

==Fictional character biography==
Shatterstar was a [[Kree]] "super-soldier" prototype who could fly and project destructive energy beams from his wrist devices.

Shatterstar ('''Arides''') was sent to Earth as part of a plant to capture the [[Inhumans]] for military use.  The Inhuman Royal Family fought Shatterstar, but discovered that his powers made him more than a match for them.  [[Black Bolt]] used the weaponry aboard Shatterstar's own ship to blast him into unconsciousness and take him back to [[Attilan]].  Attilan had been taken over by [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus the Mad]] and his allies, and when Shatterstar revived he joined forces with Maximus.  [[Triton (comics)|Triton]] goaded Shatterstar into following him into the Corridor of Memories, and tricked him into firing at a reflection of Triton in the Mirror of Eternity.  The blast reflected back at Shatterstar and apparently obliterated him.<ref>Inhumans #3-5</ref>

Much later, after Attilan had been moved to the [[Blue Area of the Moon]], Shatterstar revived himself and emerged to the surface.  He went to [[Avengers Mansion]] in search of Inhumans to abduct for his original mission.  He found [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]] and abducted her back to his Himalayan lair.  Arides tried to contact the Kree, but could not due to their subjugation by the [[Shi'ar]] after the Kree-Shi'ar War.  The [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[Fantastic Force]] found him and fought him, and [[Deathcry]] managed to convince him that the Kree were indeed ruled by the Shi'ar now.  The [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] informed Arides that he was now an energy being and not truly alive, so Arides fled back to Hala to seek answers.<ref>''Avengers'' #383</ref>
