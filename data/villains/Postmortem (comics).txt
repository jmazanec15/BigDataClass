'''Postmortem''' is a fictional cyborg supervillain in the [[Marvel Universe]]. He was an ally of [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]], and an enemy of [[Blade (comics)|Blade]]. He first appeared in ''Blade the Vampire Hunter'' #9 (March 1995).

==Fictional character biography==
Postmortem was a scientist who for decades had maintained a secret laboratory in the 13th floor of the [[Chrysler Building]] in [[Manhattan]], largely paid for with funding by [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]].<ref name="mnyc">{{cite book | last = Sanderson | first = Peter | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | year = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 49â€“51 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-4165-3141-6}}</ref> He developed a kind of [[Nanorobotics|nanite]] that could rewrite a subject's genetic code, ostensibly to create a "next generation" of [[vampire]]. The scientist tested the nanites out on himself and was transformed into Postmortem.

Postmortem was confronted in his laboratory by the vampire hunter [[Blade (comics)|Blade]], and mistook him for an agent of [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]], coming to cancel the project's funding. They fought, and Blade succeeded in killing Postmortem.{{Issue|date=May 2010}}
