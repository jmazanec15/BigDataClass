==Fictional character biography==
Gunther Strauss, a [[Nazism|Nazi agent]], was ordered by [[Adolf Hitler]] to cause a popular uprising in the United States. Acting as "the Reaper", Strauss traveled to [[Manhattan]] and claimed to be a religious [[prophet]] who had received an oracular [[Vision (spirituality)|vision]]. He promised to reveal the contents of this vision at a rally in [[Madison Square Garden]], to which a huge crowd of both the faithful and simple curiosity-seekers gathered. The Reaper exhorted the crowd to abandon morality and to attack the trappings of society, to tear down the legal system and, ultimately, the federal government itself.<ref name="mnyc">{{cite book | last = Sanderson | first = Peter | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | date = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 74â€“75, 78 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-4165-3141-6}}</ref>

After the rally, the Reaper continued his ranting speeches in New York City, and more and more people were swayed by his [[demagoguery]]. There was a surge in popular unrest in the city, rioting broke out, and a few people even attempted to attack federal buildings. [[Captain America]] and [[Bucky Barnes|Bucky]] intervened, but were told by the Reaper that he was legally untouchable, as he had broken no laws, his free speech being protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. Turning the tables, the Reaper actually filed a police complaint against them, for [[burglary|breaking and entering]], which caused the police to issue a warrant for their arrest.<ref name="cap22">{{Comic book reference | writer=[[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]] | penciller=[[Al Avison|Avison, Al]] | inker=[[Al Gabriele|Gabriele, Al]] | story=The Reaper | title=[[Captain America|Captain America Comics]] | volume=1 | issue=22 | date=January, 1943 | publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] | page= | panel= }}</ref>

Regardless, [[Captain America]] appeared at the Reaper's next rally, to publicly challenge the ideas he was putting forth. The Reaper exhorted the frenzied crowd to attack Captain America, and a large portion of it moved to do so. In the scuffle, Captain America was knocked unconscious by the Reaper, who then personally led the crowd to attack [[New York City Hall]]. While this was happening, [[Bucky Barnes|Bucky]] had acquired documentation that definitively proved the Reaper was an ''[[agent provocateur]]'' working for the [[Nazi]]s, and not an American citizen. Bucky and a revived Captain America pursued the Reaper into the [[New York City Subway]], where he was disarmed by Captain America. The Reaper attempted to flee into a subway tunnel, but fell on the electrified [[third rail]] and was killed.<ref name="cap22"/>

==Powers and abilities==
The Reaper does not appear to possess superhuman powers. He is, however, an experienced orator and [[demagogue]], capable of whipping an audience of listeners into a frenzy. He carries a large, ordinary [[scythe]], which he can use as a weapon. He also has a number of agents of the [[Nazi Party]] at his disposal.
