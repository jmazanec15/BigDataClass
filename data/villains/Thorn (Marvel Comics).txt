== Fictional character biography ==
Wanting to eliminate the Carbones, a [[crime family]] situated in [[Brooklyn]], the [[Punisher]] infiltrated the group with the aid of a petty criminal named [[Mickey Fondozzi]]. The Carbones were led by [[Julius Carbone|Julius]], whose second in-command was his brother, Salvatore.<ref> {{Cite comic|writer = Chuck Dixon|penciller = John Romita, Jr.|inker = Klaus Janson|colorist = Gregory Wright|letterer = Jim Novak|editor = Don Daley|story = Only the Dead Know Brooklyn|title = The Punisher War Zone|volume = 1|issue = #1|date = March 1992|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} </ref> While Julius welcomed Mickey and the Punisher (who had adopted the alias "Johnny Tower") into the organization, Sal disliked the two, and was suspicious of their motives, correctly assuming that they were sabotaging the Carbones' operations.<ref> {{Cite comic|writer = Chuck Dixon|penciller = John Romita, Jr.|inker = Klaus Janson|colorist = Gregory Wright|letterer = Jim Novak|editor = Don Daley|story = Blood in the Water|title = The Punisher War Zone|volume = 1|issue = #2|date = April 1992|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} </ref>

Needing leverage to get Sal off of their backs, Mickey and the Punisher spied on him, and discovered that he was consorting with rival Asian gangsters. Enraged by Sal's treachery, Julius ordered Mickey and the Punisher to dispose of him, so the two drugged Sal and drove him out to [[New Jersey]]. Due to his frequent [[narcotic]]s usage, Sal was able to resist the drugs he was given and tried to flee, but fell through the ice of a frozen lake. Believing Sal to have perished, Mickey and the Punisher left.<ref> {{Cite comic|writer = Chuck Dixon|penciller = John Romita, Jr.|inker = Klaus Janson|colorist = Gregory Wright|letterer = Jim Novak|editor = Don Daley|story = The Frame|title = The Punisher War Zone|volume = 1|issue = #3|date = May 1992|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} </ref>

Sal survived, and regained consciousness in a hospital, which he escaped from.<ref> {{Cite comic|writer = Chuck Dixon|penciller = John Romita, Jr.|inker = Klaus Janson|colorist = Gregory Wright|letterer = Jim Novak|editor = Don Daley|story = Closer to the Flame|title = The Punisher War Zone|volume = 1|issue = #4|date = June 1992|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} </ref> Recalling nothing about his past other than vague details about the people who had tried to kill him, Sal robbed and murdered a man, and began making his way to La Isla de Tiburones Durmientes, which was where Julius's daughter was about to marry a [[Sicily|Sicilian]] mobster. When a motorist he had flagged down asked him what his name was, Sal, unable to remember, replied with Thorn, a word he had glimpsed on a [[billboard]].<ref> {{Cite comic|writer = Chuck Dixon|penciller = John Romita, Jr.|inker = Klaus Janson|colorist = Gregory Wright|letterer = Jim Novak|editor = Don Daley|story = Feeding Frenzy|title = The Punisher War Zone|volume = 1|issue = #5|date = July 1992|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} </ref>

After swimming to La Isla de Tiburones Durmientes, Thorn ran amok, killing his niece's fianc√© and Julius, among others. The Punisher put a stop to Thorn's rampage by shooting him repeatedly, and knocking him into the ocean.<ref> {{Cite comic|writer = Chuck Dixon|penciller = John Romita, Jr.|inker = Klaus Janson|colorist = Gregory Wright|letterer = Jim Novak|editor = Don Daley|story = The Carrion Eaters|title = The Punisher War Zone|volume = 1|issue = #6|date = August 1992|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} </ref><ref> {{cite book|author = Robert G.

Thorn found and attacked Mickey and the Punisher, but the fight was interrupted by the boss of the dealers Thorn had killed. After massacring the head dealer and his underlings, Thorn and the Punisher continued their brawl, which ended when the Punisher threw Thorn off of a bridge, and onto a moving truck. The truck brought Thorn to New Jersey, and he was last seen wandering [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]].<ref> {{Cite comic|writer = Chuck Dixon|penciller = Dale Eaglesham|inker = Al Williamson|colorist = Christie Scheele|letterer = Bill Oakley|editor = Don Daley|story = Hurt So Good|title = The Punisher War Zone Annual|volume = 1|issue = #2|date = September 1994|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} </ref>

== Powers and abilities ==
For unexplained reasons, nearly dying in a frigid lake has left Thorn unable to feel pain, allowing him to sustain severe injuries, such as multiple gunshots, without being deterred. Thorn's brush with death has also eliminated his need for basic human necessities such as food, water, air, and protection from the elements, and made him repellent towards animals such as sharks.

== Reception ==
In a 2009 interview with [[Comic Book Resources]], illustrator [[Dale Eaglesham]] expressed fondness for the character, stating "I spent some time in the Punisher department from 93 to 95 and I really enjoyed working with Frank Castle. However, there's another Punisher-related character that I feel I have unfinished business with: Sal Carbone, the man they call Thorn. He went toe-to-toe with Castle and survived because he thinks he's already dead. He's insane, and he would actually make a great Punisher! Maybe I can talk [[Ed Brubaker]] into that one; I think he would love it".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=19910|title = NYCC: Eaglesham on his Marvel Exclusive Deal|last = Richards|first = Dave|publisher = [[Comic Book Resources]]|date = 7 February 2009|website = comicbookresources.com|accessdate = 10 February 2015}}</ref>

Thorn ranked #4 on [[Village Voice Media|The Robot's Voice]] list "The 8 Worst Punisher Villains Ever".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.therobotsvoice.com/2010/08/the_8_worst_punisher_villains_ever.php|title = The 8 Worst Punisher Villains Ever|last = Rumm|first = Ed|publisher = [[Village Voice Media|The Robot's Voice]]|date = 30 August 2010|website = therobotsvoice.com|accessdate = 10 February 2015}}</ref>
