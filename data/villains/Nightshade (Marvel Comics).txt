'''Nightshade''' ('''Tilda Johnson'''), formerly known as '''Dr. Nightshade''' and '''Deadly Nightshade''', is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
{{expand section|date=January 2016}}
Nightshade first appeared in ''Captain America'' #164 and was created by [[Steve Englehart]] and [[Alan Weiss (comics)|Alan Lee Weiss]].

==Fictional character biography==
Tilda Johnson was born into poverty in [[New York City]]. At an early age, she discovered that she had a natural aptitude for science. As a teenager, she used her extensive knowledge to begin a career as a criminal scientist.  The [[Yellow Claw]] helped her develop a method for turning normal humans into obedient werewolf-like creatures, and attempted to transform convicts into a werewolf army, but the pair were defeated by [[Captain America]] and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]<ref>''Captain America and the Falcon'' #164</ref> She later took control of a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility, and used pheromones to force Captain America to battle the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], but was defeated.<ref>''Captain America and the Falcon'' #189-190</ref>

Nightshade used robots to take over the Harlem protection rackets, but was defeated by [[Luke Cage|Power Man]] and [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]].<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #51-53</ref> She later worked with the criminals [[Stiletto (comics)|Stiletto]], [[Discus (comics)|Discus]], [[Man Mountain Marko]], and the [[Eel (comics)#Eel (Edward Lavell)|Eel]] in an attempt to rob a debutante's ball, but they were defeated and captured by Power Man and Iron Fist.<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #110</ref> She later sought to make the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] her pawn, but wound up fighting Power Man, Iron Fist, and [[Machine Man]], and was imprisoned again.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up Annual'' #3</ref>

Nightshade later appeared as second-in-command of [[Superia]]'s [[Femizons]]. She helped develop a serum to transform men into women which she used on Captain America and [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]]. She also helped Superia develop her sterilization bomb.<ref>''Captain America'' #389-391</ref>

She was also involved in a scheme with [[Dredmund Druid]], though as a double agent for Superia. She used a serum to transform Captain America and the ordinary people of Starkesboro, Massachusetts into pseudo-werewolves. She is famous in both comic-book reading circles and supervillains for having turned Captain America into a werewolf known as "Cap Wolf" for a brief period of time.<ref>''Captain America'' #403-408</ref>

Nightshade joined [[MODOK]]'s 11, with the main objective of stealing the powerful Hypernova. It has been revealed after her last battle against the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], she tried to start her life over without crime.  However, as she was self-taught and had no official degrees, the only medical job she could get was as a receptionist at a hospital.  After she pointed out a mistake by one of the doctors, she was fired immediately and contemplated suicide, until MODOK contacted her and hired her for the heist. She had "used up all my second chances" and could not afford to turn MODOK down.<ref>''MODOK's 11'' #3</ref> She developed a friendship with her teammates [[Armadillo (comics)|Armadillo]] and [[Puma (comics)|Puma]], and showed this strongly when backing up Puma in saving the [[Living Laser]]'s life (and secretly giving him his Puma powers back through her "werewolf serum"). The three of them were the only villains to remain loyal to MODOK and get their cash (with a bonus); they appear to be sticking together, and she has offered to help Puma with his legal defense.<ref>''MODOK's 11'' #5</ref>

During the ''[[Shadowland (comics)|Shadowland]]'' storyline, Nightshade organized [[Flashmob (comics)|Flashmob]] (a group of former Luke Cage enemies consisting of [[Chemistro]] III, [[Cheshire Cat (comics)|Cheshire Cat]], [[Comanche (comics)|Comanche]], [[Dontrell Hamilton|Dontrell "Cockroach" Hamilton]], [[Mr. Fish]] II, and [[Spear (comics)|Spear]]) in order to take on the new Power Man, [[Power Man (Victor Alvarez)|Victor Alvarez]]. Although Flashmob was defeated and incarcerated at [[Ryker's Island]], Nightshade's lawyer [[Big Ben Donovan]] mentions that he has plans to have them released from Ryker's Island. Donovan was able to secure the release of Dontrell Hamilton, Mr. Fish, and Spear, but Chemistro, Cheshire Cat, and Comanche had to remain incarcerated due to the warrants and/or parole violations.<ref>''Shadowland: Power Man'' #2</ref>

During the ''[[Spider-Island]]'' storyline, Nightshade is among the villains that have been infected by the bedbugs that bestowed spider powers on her. She alongside [[Cottonmouth (Cornell Cottonmouth)|Cottonmouth]] and Flashmob ended up fighting [[Heroes for Hire]].<ref>''Spider-Island: Heroes for Hire'' #1</ref>

A reformed Nightshade later allies with the [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)#Kyle Richmond (Earth-31916)|Nighthawk]] of Earth-31916, helping him defend Chicago from a group of white nationalists called the True Patriots, and a black supremacist known as "The Revelator".<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = David Walker|penciller = Ramon Villalobos|inker = Ramon Villalobos|colorist = Tamra Bonvillain|letterer = VC's Joe Caramagna|editor = Katie Kubert|title = Nighthawk|volume = 2|issue = #1|date = 25 May 2016|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> She leaves him shortly afterwards to join [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] and [[Red Wolf (comics)|Red Wolf]]'s group.<ref>''Occupy Avengers'' #4</ref> 

Sometime later, the group stops at Dungston, [[Iowa]] when their van breaks down. Hawkeye calls [[Wheels Wolinski]] to help fix the van until it is revealed that some of the residents are [[Skrulls]], who are being hunted down by mysterious men. While Hawkeye, Red Wolf and Nightshade are fighting, Wolinski discovers that the van has an A.I. system, who convinces him to help in the fight. It is later revealed that the attackers are also Skrulls, led by [[Super-Skrull]]. Wolinski then manages to turn the van into a big robot and defeats Super-Skrull. Hawkeye then negotiates with Nick Fury Jr. to provide protection for the town's residents.<ref>''Occupy Avengers'' #5-7</ref>

During the ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, while Hawkeye joins the Underground resistance following [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]]'s takeover in the United States, the rest of the team gather their own resistance army to help the people in rural areas that are being affected by Hydra's cruel treatment. Tilda also reveals that she became the new Nighthawk, after the former was killed by Hydra soldiers. After several successful victories, the resistance heads to a secret base in [[South Dakota]] and prepares for their next attack until Hydra forces raid the base. During the battle, Red Wolf and Tilda have a private conversation, in which both confess their feelings for each other, and they share a kiss. They then head out to help the resistance defeat Hydra.<ref>''Occupy Avengers'' #8-9</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Tilda Johnson is an extraordinary genius, and extensively self-taught in genetics, biochemistry, cybernetics, robotics and physics. She also obtained a doctoral degree from an undisclosed university while in prison.

Nightshade sometimes wears protective battle armor, including silver spikes for protection from attack by werewolves. She has created an array of advanced weaponry, and has built numbers of humanoid robots. She created a chemical serum to transform normal humans into werewolves under her control and has used concentrated pheromones to control men through her allure.

Nightshade apparently secretes chemical pheromones from her body that affect the will of certain animals, including werewolves, making them obedient to her commands.
