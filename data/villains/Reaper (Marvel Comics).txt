The character known most notably as the Reaper whose real name is '''Pantu Hurageb''', a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] in the ''[[X-Force]]'' comic book series. He has been a villain in the main [[Marvel Universe]] but a hero in the [[Ultraverse]].

==Publication history==
{{expand section|date=January 2015}}
The character first appeared in ''[[New Mutants]]'' #86 (February 1990), though he is not named until ''New Mutants'' #87.

==Fictional character biography==
Reaper is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[terrorist]] in the [[Mutant Liberation Front]] (MLF), and routinely fought the [[X-Men]] and [[X-Force]]. During X-Force's first mission against the MLF, [[Shatterstar]] fought Reaper and cut off one of his hands.<ref>''X-Force'' #1</ref> His hand was replaced by a cybernetic [[prosthesis]].{{Issue|date=February 2011}} In an attempt to flee from [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], the MLF's teleporter [[Zero (X-Men)|Zero]] opened a portal for Reaper and his teammates to escape through, but when [[Havok (comics)|Havok]] attacked Zero, Zero was forced to close the portal while Reaper was still in it, causing him to lose a leg as well.<ref>''X-Factor'' #77</ref> The leg was also replaced with a prosthetic.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}

When the MLF was arrested during the [[X-Cutioner's Song]], Reaper and three of his teammates were transferred to a special prison.{{Issue|date=February 2011}} They were freed by [[Reignfire]] and made part of his new MLF.{{Issue|date=February 2011}} During an attempt to kidnap [[Henry Peter Gyrich]], Reaper faced Shatterstar again and lost his other hand.{{Issue|date=February 2011}} He was thought to have been killed in the fight, but he survived.<ref>''X-Force'' #28</ref>

An attempt to recruit [[Siena Blaze]] for the MLF resulted in Siena's powers somehow transporting Reaper and Siena to the [[Ultraverse]].
There he joined the [[Exiles (Malibu Comics)|Exiles]] along with other [[Marvel Universe]] refugees [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] and [[Siena Blaze]].<ref>''All-New Exiles'' #1 (1995)</ref> Reaper bargains with the alien race known as the ''Tradesmen'' for a new upgraded version of his [[scythe]], but the Tradesman was murdered during the deal.{{Issue|date=February 2011}} The Tradesmen returned to demand a life in exchange for the Tradesman they lost and Reaper turned his scythe on Juggernaut, sending him back to the Marvel Universe.{{Issue|date=February 2011}} The Tradesmen accepted and left, but Reaper's teammates were less than happy with Reaper's actions.{{Issue|date=February 2011}} Reaper started to like life in the Ultraverse and slowly became a reluctant hero.{{Issue|date=January 2011}} He becomes intimate with the athletic 'Velvet Fist'.<ref>''Exiles'' #9 (1996)</ref> This new grouping disbands later.<ref>''Ultraforce'' (vol. 2) #13</ref>

Eventually Reaper returned to the Marvel Universe,{{Issue|date=February 2011}} and was one of the mutants incarcerated by [[Weapon X]] at ''Neverland'', their mutant death camp.{{Issue|date=February 2011}} Reaper was offered to work for Weapon X and he accepted.{{Issue|date=February 2011}} Reaper and former MLF teammate [[Wildside (comics)|Wildside]] would pose as mutant terrorists and attack civilians to increase the anti-mutant sentiment, thus reducing public backlash against the unlawful arrests committed by Weapon X.{{Issue|date=February 2011}} [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]'s [[Underground (comics)|Underground]] captured the two and during a [[telepathy|telepathic]] [[interrogation]] Cable accidentally damaged Reaper's brain, leaving him in a coma.{{Issue|date=January 2011}}

However, he was still alive and in ''New Avengers'' #18 he was confirmed to be depowered by the events of [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]],<ref>''New Avengers'' #18</ref> in which the [[Scarlet Witch]] erased the mutant [[genome]] from over 90% of the world's mutant population. Recently, in Son of M #6, [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], who had gained the power to give depowered mutants their powers back, found Reaper begging on the streets.<ref>''Son of M'' #6</ref> Reaper was the very first mutant to regain his powers and now has the Weapon X implanted scythe at his control. Reaper then joins the group called [[X-Cell]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #17 (April, 2007)</ref> During battle, [[Abyss (comics)|Abyss]] flung him and [[Fatale (comics)|Fatale]] into the Brimstone Dimension and followed them.<ref>''X-Factor'' vol. 3 #19-20 (Julyâ€“August 2007).</ref> Reaper, Abyss and Fatale were later captured and tortured by Dr. Terrence Hoffman of A.I.M. after he got them out of the Brimstone Dimension and drained their powers. They were rescued by the new X-Factor team. Before Reaper could kill Dr. Hoffman, he is stopped by Quicksilver.<ref>''All-New X-Factor'' #1-2 (2014).</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Reaper possessed the ability to generate a neurosynaptic energy field, which could slow down physical movements of living beings to the point of paralysis (he was even able to use it to battle Quicksilver), or even disrupt their nervous systems. Reaper used specially designed [[scythe]]s to channel his powers into the bodies of anyone cut by the blades. Reaper had two cybernetic hands and a cybernetic leg. None of these artificial limbs seemed to have any superhuman abilities. While in the [[Ultraverse]], Reaper was actually able to injure Juggernaut by simply slashing him with his upgraded scythe.

===After Weapon-X===
However, when he entered the Weapon X Program, he received upgrades to his mutant abilities and/or appearance like all new operatives. For Reaper, it was finally having organic limbs again, but these limbs also contained the added ability of being able to morph into a scythe-like blade for him to conduct his power through.

The status of Marvel characters' Ultraverse appearances in [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] is unclear. The stories are never referenced within Marvel Comics, but a recent [[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]] did mention events in the Ultraverse.
