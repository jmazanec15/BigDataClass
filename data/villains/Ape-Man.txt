With a group of other criminals, professional criminal Gordon "Monk" Keefer attempted a robbery of a [[Iron Man|Stark]] warehouse, and was defeated by [[Captain America]].<ref>''Avengers'' #12</ref>

Along with [[Bird-Man#Henry Hawk|Bird-Man]] I, [[Cat-Man (Marvel Comics)#Towshend Horgan|Cat-Man]] I, and [[Frog-Man (Ani-Men)|Frog-Man]] I, Keefer was recruited for his great strength by a man named the Organizer to form the [[Ani-Men]]. The Organizer was secretly Abner Jonas, a candidate for mayor of New York City, who sent the Ani-Men on missions to undermine the current administration. Daredevil defeated them and the Ani-Men and Organizer all went to prison.<ref>''Daredevil'' #10-11</ref> Later, Ape-Man, Bird-Man and Cat-Man formed a team called the "Unholy Three" with the [[Death-Stalker|Exterminator]], and fought Daredevil again.<ref>''Daredevil'' #39-41</ref> The Unholy Three, as a team of independent thieves, fought Daredevil and [[Spider-Man]] and were defeated.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #25</ref>

Ape-Man, Bird-Man, and Cat-Man later rejoined the Ani-Men, and the Ani-Men went to work for [[Count Nefaria]]. Nefaria's scientists submitted the unwitting Ani-Men to processes that gave them superhuman powers and animal-like forms. The Ani-Men invaded the Cheyenne Mountain missile base for Count Nefaria, and fought the [[X-Men]].<ref>''X-Men'' #94-95</ref>

The Ani-Men lost their superhuman powers and reverted to normal. Nefaria sent the four original Ani-Men to kill [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]]. However, the [[Spymaster (comics)#Spymaster I|Spymaster]] detonated a bomb, which was intended to kill Stark, and the resulting explosion killed the Ani-Men instead.<ref>''Iron Man'' #115-116</ref>

During the ''[[Secret Wars]]'' storyline, a third Ape-Man alongside a third Cat-Man and a second Frog-Man were shown committing crimes while the heroes were on Battleworld. They somehow got the equipment of the original Ani-Men and used it to rob a vault wagon only to be opposed by the NYPD.<ref>''Code of Honor'' #3</ref>

During the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' storyline, Ape-Man alongside the third Bird-Man and the third Cat-Man were among the villains in [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]]'s supervillain army.<ref>''Civil War: War Crimes'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Originally, Keefer had no superhuman powers. He was an athletic man with a powerful build and considerable strength, and an excellent hand-to-hand combatant trained in boxing and wrestling techniques. While employed by the Exterminator, Keefer wielded a "time-displacement ray" ("T-ray") gun that fired a ray which projected its victim into a limbo-like inter-dimensional void.  The gun could thus "displace" a victim for a limited period of time, such as 30 minutes. A ray blast of sufficient intensity could exile a victim to the inter-dimensional void permanently. Keefer was later subjected to an unknown mutagenic process administered by [[Count Nefaria]]'s scientists which temporarily gave him a build resembling that of an ape, as well as superhuman strength and enhanced agility, durability and reflexes.

McVey possessed the same abilities as the first Ape-Man, including ape-like superhuman strength, agility, durability and reflexes.
