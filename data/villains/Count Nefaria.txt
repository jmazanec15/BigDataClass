{{Expand section|date=July 2013}}
The character first appears in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #13 (February, 1965) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Don Heck]].

==Fictional character biography==
'''Luchino Nefaria''' is a wealthy Italian [[Aristocracy|aristocrat]] and traditionalist that also desires greater wealth and power, driving him to join the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] criminal organization. The recently formed [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] superhero team, however, thwart many of his plans and force a direct conflict, so Nefaria lures the Avengers to his castle on the pretence of a charity event, and places the group in suspended animation, using images which threaten to take control of America. After he releases them, the Avengers become suspicious of him after hearing they are wanted and they cannot remember what happened at the castle. They go to the castle, however nearly all of them are paralyzed by Nefaria's gas. Meanwhile, the [[Teen Brigade]] were captured by Nefaria, and when they tried to contact the Avengers were thrown in a dungeon which would place them into suspended animation if they touched the walls. [[Captain America]] gets into the castle without touching the ground, other Avengers, or walls, and freed the Teen Brigade, who gave the antidote to the Avengers. Captain America was also paralyzed, and with his hands and feet attached to ropes he was suspended between floor and ceiling, where Nefaria mocked him, saying he would be a hero for capturing him. However, Iron Man then burst through the wall. Neferia was defeated and deported after an officer heard him confess to being in the Maggia.<ref>''Avengers'' #13 (Feb. 1965)</ref> In retaliation, Nefaria then unsuccessfully attempts to destroy [[Iron Man]],<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #67 (July 1965)</ref> and then suffers yet another defeat when stopped by the [[mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[X-Men]] team.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #22 - 23 (July - Aug. 1966)</ref> Nefaria reappears several years later and attempts to take control of the United States base [[North American Aerospace Defense Command|NORAD]], but is stopped by the X-Men once again. Nefaria attempts to escape in a plane which is attacked by the X-Man [[Thunderbird (comics)|Thunderbird]]. The plane then explodes, killing Thunderbird and injuring Nefaria.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #94 - #95 (Aug. - Oct 1975)</ref>

Now virtually destitute and discredited, Nefaria hires the supervillains [[Living Laser]], [[Erik Josten|Power Man]] and [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]] to form the second [[Lethal Legion]]. The group rob several banks, and unwittingly finance an experiment Nefaria has created in a bid to become superhuman. Employing the former scientific adviser to [[Heinrich Zemo|Baron Heinrich Zemo]], Nefaria devises a means of temporarily amplifying the abilities of the Lethal Legion, and then sends them into combat against the Avengers. The effect, however, is temporary and once defeated their combined abilities are drained by Nefaria, who possesses them magnified a hundredfold. After a long and protracted battle, Nefaria is finally defeated.<ref>''Avengers'' #164 - 166 (Nov. 1977 - Jan. 1978)</ref>

Nefaria is then kept in isolation and under observation by the Avengers, and it is discovered that the process to empower him makes Nefaria immortal but vulnerable as his body reconfigures itself. Whitney Frost, also known as [[Madame Masque]] and the daughter of Nefaria, attempts to find a cure for what is believed to be his deteriorating condition. She hires the [[Ani-Men]] to attack [[Avengers Mansion]] and free her father. While battling Iron Man, Nefaria's life-support system is severed and his weakened form is crushed by a stored Jupiter Landing Vehicle.<ref>''Iron Man'' #115 - 116 (Oct. - Nov. 1978)</ref>  Nefaria briefly reappears some time later as a corpse reanimated by the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]]. Grim Reaper directs Nefaria to attack the Avengers, but loses control soon afterwards and Nefaria dies once again.<ref>''Avengers'' #353 - 354 (Early-Late Sept. 1992)</ref>

Nefaria eventually reappears, but in an [[ion]]ic humanoid form, and constantly requires ionic energy to sustain his existence. He battles Iron Man<ref>''Iron Man'' Annual 99</ref> and later Captain America and [[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-Zar]] in the [[Savage Land]] as he attempts to find sources of energy.<ref>''Captain America'' #29 - 31 (vol. 3, June 2000)</ref> Nefaria then plans to detonate an ionic bomb, which will transform millions of people into an ionic state which he can then control, perceiving it as the best way to guarantee that he receives the respect that he feels he deserves. Nefaria gains control of the ionic heroes [[Wonder Man]] and [[Erik Josten|Atlas]] who he intends to use to kill the Avengers, but he is stopped by the combined efforts of the Avengers, fellow superhero team the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] and Madame Masque, Masque using a weapon she had developed to disrupt Nefaria's own ionic energy.<ref>''Avengers'' #32 - 34 (vol. 2, Sept. - Nov. 2000) and ''Thunderbolts'' #42 - 43 (Sept. - Oct 2000)</ref> He is next seen as an inmate of [[The Raft (comics)|The Raft]], a prison for supervillains, and escapes when [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] stages a mass breakout.<ref>''New Avengers'' #1-2 (Jan-Feb 2005)</ref>

Following the ''[[Siege (comics)|Siege]]'' storyline, Madame Masque sought out her father to help the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] after [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] took back the [[Norn Stones]]. The New Avengers capture John King (Hood's cousin) and use him to track the Hood and Madame Masque. After a battle with Count Nefaria, they capture the villains and bring all four of them to Maria Hill to place them under arrest.<ref>''New Avengers Finale'' one-shot</ref>

Nefaria returns within the pages of ''[[Moon Knight]]'', having established himself as the new Kingpin of [[Los Angeles]].<ref>''Moon Knight'' vol 4 #7</ref> He kills [[Echo (Marvel Comics)|Echo]] in battle,<ref>''Moon Knight'' vol 4 #9</ref> and is later apprehended by the Avengers.<ref>''Moon Knight'' vol 4 #12</ref> Also in L.A., [[Daken]] attempts to [[assassination|kill him]] but fails.<ref>''Daken: Dark Wolverine'' #21</ref> Later, back in New York, he is summoned by [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]] to destroy [[The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl]] in her dreams, but is bested at finger-counting, and leaves.<ref>''The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl'' #11</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Count Nefaria was a normal human until subjected to a process perfected by one of Baron Heinrich Zemo's scientists Dr. Kenneth Sturdy which granted him the combined powers of the villains the [[Living Laser]] (energy projection), [[Erik Josten|Power Man]] (strength), and [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]] (speed), amplified a hundredfold.{{Issue|date=June 2010}} Because of this, Nefaria is one of the physically strongest known humans in the Marvel Universe. He has toppled a 40-story building with little effort,{{Issue|date=June 2010}} withstood a blow from Wonder Man without flinching,{{Issue|date=June 2010}} fought an enraged [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] to a standstill with no apparent damage from strikes of his [[Mjolnir (comics)|hammer]], even stopping it with his bare hand,<ref>''Avengers'' #166</ref> and has withstood simultaneous attacks by multiple teams of Avengers at once and laughed it off.{{issue|date=December 2014}}

The character then aged until his body evolved,{{Issue|date=June 2010}} and eventually shifted to an ionic form, able to create ionic constructs and manipulate other ionic beings.{{Issue|date=June 2010}} As such, Nefaria is now effectively immortal, and virtually indestructible. He also has the power of flight when before he could only leap great distances.{{issue|date=November 2010}} He once showcased a new power allowing him to surround his opponents in ionic energy and move them wherever telekinetically.<ref>''New Avengers #2''</ref>  Although it is possible to deplete Nefaria's ionic energy in combat by forcing him to expend energy faster than his body can replenish it, [[Henry Pym|Giant-Man]] has calculated that it would take three weeks of constant combat – without even giving Nefaria time to pause for breath – for even the combined forces of the Avengers and the Thunderbolts to deplete Nefaria's ionic energy reserves completely in that manner.{{issue|date=November 2010}} However, Madame Masque has developed a weapon that disrupts Nefaria's ionic energy.<ref>''Avengers'' vol.2 #34</ref>
