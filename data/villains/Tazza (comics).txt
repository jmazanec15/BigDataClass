==Fictional character biography==
Lord Tazza is the undisputed ruler of a faraway dimension "on the edges of Infinity", the Kingdom of Tazza, which has a population if one; that is, Tazza is the sole inhabitant of the land. Trapped in his stronghold's "Hall of Heroes" are sorcerers like the Lords of the Netherworld. [[Doctor Strange]], in search of his sorceress friend [[Clea]], trespasses into Tazza's kingdom via the means of magic, thinking that Tazza is Clea's abductor, having been fooled by [[Dormammu]]'s associate Asti. A battle between Strange and Tazza ensues, with the Sorcerer Supreme emerging as champion. Strange frees all of the captured prisoners and with that, the mystic departs from the Kingdom of Tazza.<ref name="Zota 1">{{cite comic|writer=[[Roy Thomas]]|artist=[[Steve Ditko]]|title=[[Strange Tales]]|issue=144|date=May 1966|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=New York City|story=Where Man Hath Never Trod!}}</ref>
