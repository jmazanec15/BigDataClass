'''Aegis''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[Cosmic entities (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entity]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

She is a member of the [[Proemial Gods]] and an ally of fellow member, [[Tenebrous (Marvel Comics)|Tenebrous]].

==Fictional character biography==

===Origin and War===
Shortly after the [[Big Bang]] of the [[Earth-616|Marvel universe]], the Proemial Gods arose from the very universe itself, collectively existing to maintain the cosmic consonance between order and chaos in the universe and to prepare "what exists for what is to come."<ref name=novacorpsfiles>''Annihilation: Nova Corps Files'' (Sept. 2006),</ref> Individually, each Proemial God became a caretaker of a specific universal mechanism, with Aegis of All Sorrows being tasked with "culling the living universe of divergences and aberrations."<ref name=heraldsGalactus2>''Annihilation: Heralds of Galactus'' #2 (May 2007)</ref> Over time the universe evolves, and life-forms begin to populate the cosmos. As each unique life-form enacts decisions and choices, cosmic consonance as a whole is served. This ultimately renders the Proemial Gods unnecessary. One of the Proemial Gods, Diableri of Chaos, convinces  many of his brethren—including Aegis and Tenebrous—to prevent their obsolescence by a plan to remake the universe in his image. [[Civil war]] ensues among the Proemial Gods, and eventually Diableri and his allies bring the battle to Galactus. Galactus slays Diableri, and imprisons Aegis—along with Tenebrous (and possibly the neutral Antiphon the Overseer)—within the [[Kyln]].<ref name="heraldsGalactus2"/>

===Annihilation===
The events of the [[Annihilation Wave]] find the Kyln prison facility compromised, allowing Aegis and Tenebrous to escape. Meanwhile, [[Thanos]] of [[Titan (Marvel Comics)|Titan]] is tasked by [[Annihilus]], the orchestrator of the Annihilation Wave, to discover the secret of the [[Power Cosmic]]. Thanos approaches Teneberous and Aegis and forms an alliance with them against their common enemy, Galactus. Aegis, Tenebrous, and Thanos engage and defeat Galactus and the [[Silver Surfer]] in battle, delivering them to [[Annihilus]] for experimentation.<ref name=annihilation1>''Annihilation'' #1 (Oct. 2006)</ref>

===Death, "Rebirth", and Death===
After the events of the Annihilation Wave, Aegis and Tenebrous return to the Kyln, discovering the carcass of Antiphon. Galactus, having escaped from containment, seeks to bring a final close to the ambitions of Aegis and Tenebrous. Galactus sends the Silver Surfer ahead, and the herald decides to manoeuvre them into the nearby [[Antimatter#Antiuniverse|Crunch]] barrier that separates the universe from the [[Negative Zone]]. Overwhelmed by the Crunch energies, both Aegis and Tenebrous seemingly met their deaths.<ref name="heraldsGalactus2"/>

Despite their apparent deaths during the aftermath of the Annihilation War—which may or may not be 'explained' away as merely the destruction of their [[Cosmic entity (Marvel Comics)|M-bodies]]—Aegis and Tenebrous reappear alongside Galactus and the Celestials, fighting against the forces of the Cancerverse.<ref name=thanosImperative2>''The Thanos Imperative'' #2 (Jul. 2010)</ref>

During this battle - which according to the Silver Surfer is occurring on multiple levels of reality not visible to most lesser beings - Aegis is apparently overwhelmed by the cosmic forces of the Cancerverse and destroyed.<ref>"The Thanos Imperative," issue #3 (August 2010)</ref> Which in future issues as with other cosmic abstracts may again be written off as the destruction of the M-body.

==Powers and abilities==
Although the full extent of her powers is unknown, Aegis possesses cosmic abilities similar to that of other Proemial Gods, and has been described as a "possessor of power on par with Galactus".<ref>''Annihilation: Silver Surfer'' #4 (Sept. 2006)</ref> Aegis has displayed concussive force sufficient to incapacitate [[Galactus]],<ref name="annihilation1"/> make instant hyper-jumps throughout the universe,<ref name="heraldsGalactus2"/> and cosmic awareness.
