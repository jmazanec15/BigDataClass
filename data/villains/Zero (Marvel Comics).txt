===Fictional character biography===
Zero was an [[android (robot)|android]] created 2000 years in the future by the [[Askani]] as a prototype for the Ambient-energy Damping Automated peacekeeping Mechanisms (ADAMs){{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}. Only one other ADAM has appeared in comics: Eleven, who worked for the Askani Clan Chosen{{Issue|date=May 2009}}. Zero was damaged and found by the mutant [[Stryfe]], who opposed both the Askani and their enemies, the Neo-Canaanites.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Stryfe reactivated Zero, but didn't repair its speech-functions, leaving Zero mute{{Issue|date=May 2009}}. Zero would function as Stryfe's most trusted ally, bodyguard and, due to its ability to [[Teleportation|teleport]], transportation as Stryfe's "displacement unit." Its programming ensured complete obedience to Stryfe{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}. When Stryfe's armies were defeated by the Neo-Canaanites, Stryfe and Zero fled, traveling back in time to the late 20th century{{Issue|date=May 2009}}.

In the 20th century, Stryfe gathers several young [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] like himself, who are displeased with the way mutants are treated and form the terrorist organization the [[Mutant Liberation Front]]. Stryfe's technology and Zero's teleportation make the MLF one of the most dangerous organizations in existence,{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} and they are opposed initially by [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] and the [[New Mutants]], and later by [[X-Force]] and [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]. Though unable to teleport to places he has not been before, Zero's ability is still useful as an all-purpose escape route, allowing the MLF to infiltrate high-security installations, set bombs without needing to worry about leaving themselves a way out.<ref>''New Mutants'' #86–88</ref><ref>''X-Force'' #1</ref><ref>''X-Factor'' #77</ref> Zero also teleports Stryfe seven years in the past, and teleports the Mutant Liberation Front members on museum thefts in the present.<ref>''Cable: Blood and Metal'' #1–2</ref> Zero later brought [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey]] to Stryfe.<ref>''X-Force'' #16</ref> At the conclusion of a lengthy conflict between Stryfe and his many enemies, Stryfe is defeated on the moon<ref>''X-Force'' #18</ref> and Zero disappears and is deactivated.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

Zero ends up in the possession of the arms dealer Tolliver, an alias of [[Genesis (Marvel Comics)|Tyler Dayspring]], son of Cable. Zero is reactivated while the mercenaries [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]], [[Copycat (Marvel Comics)|Copycat]], [[Garrison Kane]] and [[Slayback]] are all looking for "the ultimate weapon", which turns out to be Zero. Zero is now capable of speech and following its original programming: peacekeeping. It scans its surroundings for any threat to peace on Earth and eliminates Slayback. He is about to eliminate Deadpool as well, but Deadpool convinces Zero that he has potential for good as well by saving Copycat's life.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Fabian Nicieza|penciller = Joe Madureira|inker = Mark Farmer and Harry Candelario|colorist = Glynis Oliver|letterer = Chris Eliopoulos|editor = Suzanne Gaffney|title = Deadpool: The Circle Chase|volume = 1|issue = #1–4|date = August – November 1993|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

Zero joins Tyler Dayspring for a short while, helping him in finding out the true relationship between Cable and Stryfe{{Issue|date=May 2009}}, but it leaves Tyler to go on its own quest: to achieve full sentience and become "alive"{{Issue|date=May 2009}}. It senses the potential to be alive in the techno-organic being [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Douglock]] and gives it independence from the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]].<ref>''Excalibur'' #77 (May 1994)</ref> Zero sets out to teach Douglock about his new existence, but Zero is now hunted by killer androids, programmed by Stryfe to destroy Zero in case of his death{{Issue|date=May 2009}}. Zero and Douglock are assisted by Excalibur and together they try to deactivate the androids from Stryfe's secret base below [[The Pentagon]]. Here, Zero realizes that he has become sentient and also the reason why Stryfe wanted him killed: locked within his databanks, Zero has all the secrets of the [[Legacy Virus]], Stryfe's final "gift" to the world. This revelation activates Zero's self-destruct sequence and the killer androids in Stryfe's base. [[Shadowcat]] manages to remove the self-destruction device, but Zero realized that it was just programmed to think it was alive. Zero sacrifices itself to protect Excalibur, Douglock and a family of innocents from the base's self-destruction, but in its last few moments on Earth, Zero is granted full sentience and becomes truly alive, but also sets off a self-destruct device in the base to kill Zero. As this happens, a recording of Stryfe delivers the taunting message, "Congratulations. You're human. For the next eight seconds." In its last moments on Earth, Zero transfers all of its memories to Douglock.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

After Zero's destruction, the Mutant Liberation Front reappears{{Issue|date=May 2009}}. At one point they had multiple Zero androids working for them{{Issue|date=May 2009}}, but these probably were copies of the original.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

===Powers and abilities===
Zero's primary task was peace-keeping and to do so it was equipped with scanners, capable of determining a person or objects capabilities, purpose and potential. It could then use its ability to damp and project energy to neutralize any threats, turning most advanced weapons useless and killing any potentially dangerous humans.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Zero also had the ability to [[Teleportation|teleport]]: it creates teleportational warps between two different points through which it and others could travel, but it could only keep these portals open for a short period of time{{Issue|date=May 2009}}. Zero cannot teleport to any location it has not been to before.<ref>''New Mutants'' #87</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
In ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'' #84, the leader of the [[Mutant Liberation Front]], Ultimate [[Stryfe#Other versions|Stryfe]], is saved from a [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinel]] attack by a young teleporter named Zero. This Zero appears to be a pale-skinned young man or teen with no mouth, but otherwise normal facial features. Whether Zero is a mutant or an artificial being remains to be seen. Zero is used multiple times as a getaway plan for Stryfe; his leader was simply a shill for the company Fenris International. Said company actually controlled the Sentinels.

When Stryfe again used Zero to teleport away from an attacking fleet of Sentinels and encountered the X-Men, Zero fled, teleporting himself away to an unknown location and leaving Stryfe at the mercy of the X-Men <ref>"Ultimate X-Men" #87</ref>

In ''[[Ultimate Comics: X-Men]]'' #18, during the mutant liberation a character identified as 'ADAM a.k.a. ZERO.' is seen aiding in the dismantling of [[William Stryker#Other versions|Stryker]] Camp 14. However unlike the previous appearance the character is able to speak.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: X-Men'' #18</ref>
