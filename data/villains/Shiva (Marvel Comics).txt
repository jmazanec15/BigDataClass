'''''Shiva''''', a program that manifests itself as an armored robot, was designed to eliminate rogue survivors of the [[Weapon X]] program. The robots themselves, in addition to the program, were created by [[Larry Hama]] and [[Marc Silvestri]], in [[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]] #50. The program learns, and sends out new 'clones' of the original robot, that can't be defeated the same way twice.

==Fictional character biography==
Wolverine begins badgering [[Professor X]] to read his mind, in a sequel to [[Barry Windsor-Smith]]'s Weapon X Saga. Finally, he goes to Canada, with oft-teammate [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]]. They explore the broken down Weapon X facility, and leave, finding nothing. Logan's entrance switches on a program, Shiva.

The Shiva program creates a robot, designed to take down surviving Weapon X members, and combats Wolverine. He defeats it, but a second one appears. Wolverine eventually defeats this one, and the program goes to the next target on a list: Sabretooth.

Sabretooth is at a wrestling show, when Shiva appears. Sabretooth defeats some more Shiva robots, and Shiva remains unheard of for a long time, presumably tracking down other Weapon X survivors.

===Wolverine: Origins===
When Wolverine regains his memories following [[House of M]] and tracks down keys to his past, he decides to return to his second classic uniform, the brown one. Government members trying to avoid Logan's wrath send a new Shiva robot after Logan, and he defeats this one using his newly claimed sword.

==Powers and abilities==
Shiva is a series of robots that learn from the mistake of a previous model; when one unit is destroyed, a new one is initiated that cannot be defeated the same way the previous one can. Being a robot, they are made of durable metal, and have great strength and survivability.

==In other media==
Shiva was featured as the main antagonist in the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' animated series episode "Weapon X, Lies and Videotape".
