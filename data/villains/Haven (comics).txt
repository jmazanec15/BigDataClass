'''Haven (Radha Dastoor)''' is a fictional [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Her first appearance was in ''X-Factor #96''.

==Fictional character biography==
Haven was the best-selling author of a book about the new humanity that would be the result of humans and mutants evolving into one race. However, her true goal was to bring about this change by destroying three-quarters of the world in a Mahapralaya, or 'Great Destruction', as foretold in her [[Hindu]] teachings.<ref>X-Factor (1st series) #98</ref>

She was opposed by [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], but was able to sway [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]] by curing her of the genetic engineering that had turned her into a mindless [[Genosha]]n mutate, allowing her to once again assume human form. X-Factor stopped the satellites that Haven was going to use to unleash earthquakes all over the world, and shut down her operation with the help of her brother [[Monsoon (comics)|Monsoon]]. Then, she attempted to cure [[Jamie Madrox]] from the [[Legacy Virus]], although he died soon after, unknown was the fact that he was not the original, leaving X-Factor to believe the original Madrox was dead.<ref>X-Factor (1st series) #99-100</ref>

Haven herself had no powers. Instead, an unborn fetus inside her was the mutant, with various abilities ranging from healing to telepathy to opening dimensional portals. The fetus acted through Haven, so the true nature of the mutancy was unknown to the public at large. The fetus was the result of an affair that she had when she was younger, but it never came to term, instead remaining a sentient embryo.<ref>X-Factor Annual #9</ref>

Haven escaped X-Factor, but her efforts to cause destruction attracted the attention of the [[Adversary (comics)|Adversary]], who used her fetus to rebirth himself into the world, consuming Haven in the process.<ref>X-Factor (1st series) #117</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
By accessing the mutant fetus within her, Radha can open any number of interdimensional crossways into her own personal side dimension, a pocket area of the universe in which she can manipulate reality.
