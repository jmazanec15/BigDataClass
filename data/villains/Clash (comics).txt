When Spider-Man was aided in battle [[Ms. Marvel (Kamala Khan)|Ms. Marvel]] and discovered that she has an [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] baby that she took from Doctor Minerva, Clash turned against Doctor Minerva and her henchmen.

During the ''[[Civil War II]]'' storyline, the Inhuman [[Ulysses (comics)|Ulysses Cain]] had a vision where Clayton Cole becomes Clash again and attacks Spider-Man.<ref>''Civil War II: The Amazing Spider-Man'' #1</ref> Clayton Cole later meets Sully back when he used to work for Owl and can't talk to him long without violating his parole. Later on, Clayton's parents have become displeased that their son is working as an "office drone" while his father wants Peter Parker to help with their retirement. While showing his latest project for the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] to Peter Parker, Clayton is told that he should talk to him if he has any problems. Upon hearing Ulysses' vision of him when he arrives in Peter Parker's office, Clayton resigns from Parker Industries. At Moynihan's Social Club, Clayton tells Sully and another person on how companies like [[Roxxon Energy Corporation]] are destroying the planet. Afterwards, Clayton meets [[Mendel Stromm]] who makes a reference to how [[Norman Osborn]] stole his work and left him poor. After providing Clayton with the number for the [[Tinkerer]], Mendel gives Clayton a day to consider helping him in his revenge on [[Harry Osborn]].

When Clash attacks Robot Master stating that he will look out for himself, Robot Master unleashes his robots on Clash even when Spider-Man arrives. Spider-Man manages to web Robot Master in the air with foam web. When Spider-Man was talking Clash into getting back to the civilized life, Robot Master rises and attacks them. While Clash flies away, Spider-Man defeats Robot Master by ripping his remote control mechanics from within his robot body, deactivating his robot army. When Clayton states that he was trying to protect Parker Industries from Mendel Stromm, Spider-Man stated that he caused harm with his technology, caused millions of dollars worth of damages, and violated his parole. Though Peter Parker did talk to Clayton's [[Probation officer|parole officer]] where he stated that Clayton acted in self-defense and that Clayton will have to give up on working on sonic technology.
