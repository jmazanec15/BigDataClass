Red Skull sent Crossbones to observe [[Baron Helmut Zemo|Baron Zemo]]'s progress acquiring the [[Ulysses Bloodstone|Bloodstone]] fragments and to obtain them.<ref>''Captain America'' #359–360</ref> He stowed aboard [[Captain America]]'s flagship, and entered Zemo's ship to steal the Bloodstone fragments.

Desperate to regain his position as leader of the Skeleton Crew, Crossbones kidnapped Diamondback, imprisoning her in an abandoned subway station and forced her into a brutal regime of combat training.{{issue|date=January 2013}} Crossbones believed that he had brainwashed her into betraying Captain America, but Diamondback was actually laying a trap for Crossbones.{{issue|date=January 2013}} She stole samples of Captain America's blood from the Avengers' mansion, then accompanied Crossbones to the Red Skull's mountain fortress.{{issue|date=January 2013}} The two were captured and imprisoned, and the Red Skull rehired Crossbones on a temporary basis.{{issue|date=January 2013}} He was later attacked by [[Cutthroat (comics)|Cutthroat]], new leader of the Skeleton Crew, who feared that Crossbones will try to take back his position as the Red Skull's right-hand man.{{issue|date=January 2013}} Crossbones killed him, never realizing that Cutthroat was actually Diamondback's older brother, Danny.{{issue|date=January 2013}} Crossbones later stabbed Diamondback during her escape attempt, only to later save her with a blood transfusion in order to use her as bait.{{issue|date=January 2013}} He was critically wounded by flying shrapnel during an assault on the fortress by Captain America and [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], and imprisoned.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

In ''[[Fallen Son: The Death of Captain America]]'', [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] along with Daredevil and the help of [[Doctor Strange]], broke into S.H.I.E.L.D. to interrogate Crossbones and threatened to kill him. Crossbones revealed no knowledge of his hiring by the Red Skull. Wolverine left him a bloody mess on the floor after being convinced by Daredevil to spare his life.<ref>''Fallen Son: The Death of Captain America''</ref>

S.H.I.E.L.D. Director [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] arranged for [[Professor X]] to scan Crossbones' mind for information, but Professor X found that someone (implied to be [[Doctor Faustus (comics)|Doctor Faustus]]) had erased several parts of his memory in order to prevent such a scan.{{Issue|date=February 2010}} Sin and a new incarnation of the [[Serpent Squad]] have broken Crossbones free of S.H.I.E.L.D. custody.{{Issue|date=February 2010}} They then capture Winter Soldier when he confronts Lukin to find out his relationship with the Red Skull.{{Issue|date=February 2010}}

He uses this ability to murder a police officer.<ref name="Thunderbolts #149">''Thunderbolts'' #149</ref> Fearing that the Thunderbolts are close to being disbanded following Cage's decision to leave, Crossbones attempted to escape alongside [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]] and [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]]. During the attempt, Crossbones used his new ability to fight an unsuspecting Steve Rogers. Crossbones was defeated and discharged from the Thunderbolts, after Ghost revealed his murder of the police officer.<ref name="Thunderbolts #150">''Thunderbolts'' #150</ref> Crossbones is shown incarcerated in a padded cell wearing a straitjacket, apparently no longer able to use his energy beam.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #151</ref>

During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Crossbones was constantly harassed while he was behind bars, because he was both a former Thunderbolt member and a neo-nazi.

During the ''[[Avengers: Standoff!]]'' storyline, Crossbones was an inmate of Pleasant Hill, a gated community established by S.H.I.E.L.D. When Steve Rogers was at the Pleasant Hill Bowling Alley trying to reason with Kobik, Crossbones attacks Rogers. Before Crossbones can kill Rogers, Kobik uses her powers to de-age Rogers back to his physical prime, which allows him to defeat Crossbones.<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #7</ref> In the aftermath of the events at Pleasant Hill, Crossbones founds a new version of HYDRA with the Red Skull and Sin.<ref>''Avengers Standoff: Assault on Pleasant Hill Omega'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
An expert combatant trained in warfare, Crossbones is an accomplished military tactician, and is thus able to formulate strategies on the battlefield. He also has extensive training in martial arts, street-fighting, marksmanship, and various forms of hand-to-hand [[combatives|combat]]. He once served as a student at the [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]]'s school for criminals, before becoming an instructor there himself.{{issue|date=December 2015}} Physically, Crossbones is tall and well built, but moves with an athletic grace uncommon for a man of his bulk. In addition, he is proficient in the use of various weapons, such as guns, bows, and throwing knives. One of Crossbones' primary weapons are spring-loaded stiletto blades housed in his gauntlets. He also has experience with torture and [[brainwashing]], having effectively "reprogrammed" Sin,{{issue|date=November 2010}} and nearly so with [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Diamondback]].{{issue|date=November 2010}}

As a member of the Thunderbolts, Crossbones was exposed to corrupted Terrigen Mists during a mission,<ref name="Thunderbolts #147"/> and shortly after manifested the ability to generate a circle of energy in front of his face which could fire energy beams capable of piercing and burning his targets.<ref name="Thunderbolts #149"/> The ability developed to the point where flames engulfed the entirety of his head while still allowing him to fire focused energy beams,<ref name="Thunderbolts #150"/> though these flames could seemingly be doused in water. While his power is active, Crossbones does not appear to be entirely impervious to the flames he generates. After the flames died following his first usage, his mask appeared to have been burnt away and his face was heavily scarred.<ref name="Thunderbolts #150"/>

After an intense battle, Captain America gains the upper hand and destroys Crossbones's strength-enhancing gauntlets, before knocking him to the ground. Crossbones then takes his helmet off to reveal his scarred face. Defeated, Crossbones detonates an [[explosive belt|explosive vest]], hoping to take the captain with him. However, Scarlet Witch briefly contains the explosion with her powers, and attempts to levitate Crossbones above the ground, but the bomb detonates next to a building, presumably killing him, causing it to collapse and kill several civilians, some of which were Wakandan visitors as goodwill workers, kicking off the central plot (the introduction of the [[Registration Acts (comics)|Sokovia Accords]]).
