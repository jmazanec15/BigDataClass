===Unnamed criminal===
After Aaron Nicholson lost his physical form, his gear was sold to [[Roderick Kingsley]] who gave it to an unknown criminal.

==Powers and abilities==
The first Answer underwent genetic manipulation to grant him the ability to develop any power needed in a certain situation. For example, if surrounded by thugs, he will gain superhuman strength and durability, allowing him to defeat them.<ref>''The Lethal Foes of Spider-Man'' #1</ref> In another situation, he may obtain pyrokinesis or the ability to turn himself into pure energy. Flight may be an ability that is always active. Other than that, at rest or not in any sort of situation, he will display no abilities. The powers he manifests typically last for five minutes, and he can display up to two separate powers at once.<ref>''I ♥ Marvel: Outlaw Love'' #1</ref> He also has superhuman intelligence and intuition. The Answer wears body armor that was created with the help of the Kingpin's scientists. The armor is coated with a friction-eliminating chemical that allows him to slip from any grasp or prevent anything from adhering to him.
