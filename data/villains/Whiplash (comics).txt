As Blacklash, Scarlotti then finds and kills the assassin, and vows to abandon the identity of Blacklash forever.<ref>''Elektra'' #5–7 (March–May 1997)</ref> Scarlotti, however, is hired by a rival of Stark and returns as Whiplash, with an upgraded costume and new weaponry.

The second Whiplash is '''Leeann Foreman''', a professional criminal born in [[Wilmington, Delaware]]. She was a mutant with unrevealed abilities and used [[adamantium]] wires connected to her gloves as whips. She was part of Critical Mass's mutant [[Band of Baddies]]. The Baddies kidnapped a mutant girl and her father in order to coerce them to join their band. They forced the daughter to knock out [[Spider-Man]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], but they quickly recovered. The daughter then unleashed her powers, blew up the warehouse they were in, and defeated all of the Baddies. Whiplash disappeared after the daughter's telekinetic explosion enabled her to get free.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #49-50</ref>

She later joined the [[Femme Fatales (comics)|Femme Fatales]], and was hired by the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] to lure Spider-Man into a trap by threatening a United Nations ambassador. Spider-Man defeated the Femme Fatales and saved the ambassador.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #340</ref> The Fatales then joined forces with the [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]] and the [[Tarantula (Marvel Comics)#Luis Alvarez|Tarantula]], but all of them were defeated by Spider-Man and the [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #343</ref> The Femme Fatales later received an invitation to join [[Superia]] and her organization of female criminals, the [[Femizons]].

===Whiplash and Blacklash duo===
Two villains, a woman who is the third Whiplash and a man who is the second Blacklash, appear during the outset of the [[Civil War (comics)|Superhuman Civil War]]. Both are past associates of the [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]] ([[Fenris (comics)|Andreas von Strucker]]) and frequenters of BDSM events before becoming supervillains. The duo are forcibly recruited into the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #104 (Sept. 2006)</ref>

===Construct===
This version of Whiplash is not a person, but a personality construct created by the aptly named '''Badgal'''. The construct is feminine and thus tends to possess females. Initially, Badgal used this construct to possess a random citizen, but later used it to possess [[Honey Lemon]] and later [[GoGo Tomago]].<ref>Big Hero 6 #3-4</ref> When the [[Big Hero 6 (comics)|Big Hero 6]] defeat Badgal, this construct ceased to exist.<ref>Big Hero 6 #5</ref>

'''Anton Vanko''' ({{lang-ru|Антон Ванко}}) is a young scientist from a small Russian village by the name of Volstok who has no relation to the original [[Crimson Dynamo]]. One day, the village is attacked by someone wearing a stolen suit of [[Iron Man's armor|Iron Man armor]], who murders a number of townspeople, including Vanko's father '''[[Igor Vanko]]''' ({{lang-ru|И́горь Ва́нко}}) in an attempt to frame [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]].

Using a specialized rifle, Vanko is able to shoot the impostor just before he flees, causing the chest plate on the armor to come off. Vanko becomes obsessed with exacting vengeance on Stark, still believing him to be the man who attacked his village, and decides to use the chest plate to fashion a suitable weapon to do so. Over the next six months, he reverse engineers a suit of body armor equipped with energy whips, and vows to kill Stark in order to avenge his father.<ref>''Iron Man vs Whiplash'' #1</ref>

After breaking into the prison where Stark is being held for his alleged crimes, Vanko kills several guards and attempts to track down and murder Stark and his confidant [[Pepper Potts]]. Stark fights off Vanko using a crude suit of Iron Man armor fashioned from parts of various machines around the prison, and forces him to flee. After Stark tracks down the criminal syndicate who framed him, Vanko arrives at their headquarters, intent on finishing off Iron Man once and for all. It is there that Vanko learns that Stark was indeed framed and that the syndicate was hired to destroy Volstok by secret international consortium funded by several governments including USA and Russia, notably Russian Prime Minister [[Vladimir Putin]], in order to wipe out an activist who was creating anti-Putin sentiments. Despite learning of Iron Man's innocence, Vanko makes one final attempt to kill him, claiming that even though he did not destroy the village, his technology did. After the building catches fire, both men are ultimately forced to run to safety, and Vanko then makes his escape. Following this, Stark is cleared of his alleged crimes, and helps rebuild Volstok. As this is happening, Vanko is seen in Moscow approaching Saint Basil's Cathedral in the [[Red Square]] preparing to properly exact vengeance this time around.<ref>''Iron Man vs. Whiplash'' #2-4</ref>

Whiplash is later recruited by Max Fury as a member of the [[Shadow Council]]'s incarnation of the [[Masters of Evil]].<ref>''Harley-Davidson / Avengers'' #1-2 (March, September 2012)</ref><ref>''Secret Avengers'' #21.1 (January 2012)</ref>

During the ''[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]'' storyline, Whiplash is among the villains recruited by [[Spymaster (comics)|Spymaster]] to help him in a plot to attack the almost-defenseless Stark Tower.<ref>''Infinity: Heist'' #1</ref>

He later attacks [[Squirrel Girl]] and her sidekick Tippy-Toe when he mistakes her for Iron Man, since she was wearing one of his armors, but is later defeated.<ref>''The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl'' Vol. 1 #2-3</ref>

===Female Blacklash===
As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event, a female supervillain takes the name of Blacklash. The female Blacklash was hired by [[Power Broker]] through the Hench App to protect his unveiling of Hench App 2.0. She ended up fighting [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Ant-Man]] and [[Giant-Man]] (Raz Malhotra) when they show up to confront Power Broker. The battle ends with Blacklash escaping due to Giant-Man's crime fighting inexperience.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Nick Spencer|penciller = Ramon Rosanas|inker = Ramon Rosanas|colorist = Jordan Boyd and Wil Quintana|letterer = VC's Travis Lanham|editor = Wil Moss|title = The Astonishing Ant-Man|volume = 1|issue = #5|date = 24 February 2016|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Mark Scarlotti, courtesy of [[Justin Hammer]], wears a [[bulletproof]] costume and wields a pair of cybernetically-controlled titanium whips that can extend to be swung fast enough to deflect bullets, or become rigid and be used as nunchaku or vaulting-poles. He also carries a variety of devices in a weapons pouch, including anti-gravity bolas and a necro-lash which releases electrical energy generated by his gauntlets. Scarlotti is a research engineer and weapons design specialist, with a college degree in engineering.

Leeann Foreman wears two gauntlets containing three spring-loaded retractable omnium steel whip-like cables on each of her arms. Each cable can extend a maximum length of about 25 feet and contains needle-sharp adamantium barbs on the tips. She wears a padded costume of synthetic stretch fabric laced with [[kevlar]], leather shoulder padding, and steel breastplates and mask, which provides her some protection from physical damage.

The unnamed Whiplash and Blacklash have no apparent superhuman abilities, relying on advanced energized whips.

Anton Vanko possesses a suit of armor equipped with two energy whips built into the wrists. The whips are shown to be powerful enough to slash through a metal staircase, as well as deflect a barrage of gunfire.<ref>''Iron Man vs Whiplash'' #2</ref> He is also a skilled athlete and possesses a deep understanding of robotics, enough that he was able to fashion his suit from a destroyed piece of Stark technology.

==Other versions==

===Ultimate Marvel===
[[Orson Scott Card]]'s ''[[Ultimate Iron Man]]'' features an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] version named '''Marc Scott''', a businessman competing with Tony Stark for military contracts via his company Whiplash.<ref>''Ultimate Iron Man'' vol. 2, #1 – 4 (Feb. – May 2008) & #5 (Oct. 2008)</ref>

The [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Whiplash appears in the 150th issue of ''Ultimate Spider-Man''. He is among a crowd as at [[Ultimate Iron Man (comics)|Tony Stark]]'s donation party outside the [[New York Hall of Science]], when he attacks him, only to be stopped by [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]]. He is seen wielding two electrical whips powered by some kind of battery. When asked by Stark as to why he is attacking him, Whiplash believes he is on a "mission from [[God]] to kill Tony Stark". It is revealed that he indeed is a [[Russians|Russian]] terrorist named Anton Vanko.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #150</ref>

A new, female version of Whiplash later appears as part of a team of mercenaries known as the Femme Fatales.<ref>''All-New Ultimates'' #8</ref>
