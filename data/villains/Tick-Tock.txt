'''Tick-Tock''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
Tick-Tock's first appearance was in ''Spider-Woman #50'' (June 1983), and he was created by [[Ann Nocenti]] and [[Brian Postman]].

The character subsequently appears in ''Captain America'' #330-331 (June-July 1987), ''Solo Avengers'' #3 (February 1988), ''West Coast Avengers'' #40 (January 1989), and ''Avengers West Coast'' #76-79 (November 1991-February 1992).

Tick-Tock appeared as part of the "Night Shift" entry in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update '89]]'' #5.

==Fictional character biography==
Tick-Tock assisted the Locksmith in capturing various super-heroes and villains in [[San Francisco]] and keeping them in [[Locksmith (comics)|Locksmith]]'s prisons. Among their captives was [[Tigra]], [[Poltergeist (comics)|Poltergeist]], [[Angar the Screamer]], [[Flying Tiger (comics)|Flying Tiger]], [[Skein (comics)|Gypsy Moth]], [[Killer Shrike]], [[Needle (comics)|Needle]], [[Tatterdemalion (comics)|Tatterdemalion]], the [[Werewolf by Night|Werewolf]], [[Daddy Longlegs (comics)|Daddy Longlegs]], [[Nekra]], The [[Enforcer (comics)|Enforcer]], [[Hangman (Marvel Comics)#Harlan Krueger|Hangman]] and [[Dansen Macabre]].<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #47-49</ref>

Tick-Tock assisted in the capture of [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]], and helped Locksmith imprison her with their other captives. He used his power to help prevent break-outs, anticipating the prisoners' attempts before they could happen, but he did not foresee that when Spider-Woman broke out, she would change costumes with Gypsy Moth. Placing the two women in each other's cells, Spider-Woman was able to escape, and set all of the captives free. Locksmith collapsed, and Tick-Tock was sent to prison.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #50</ref>

Tick-Tock later joined the [[Shroud (comics)|Shroud]]'s [[Night Shift (comics)|Night Shift]], and assisted in their assault upon the Power Broker alongside [[Captain America]] (pretending to be hypnotized by Dansen Macabre). Tick-Tock was instrumental in getting them past the guards at the gate by predicting their movements. Tick-Tock helped Captain America and the Shroud guard the prisoners they took inside the Power Broker's mansion, and ultimately escaped with the Night Shift, evading the authorities.<ref>''Captain America'' #330-331</ref>

Later, Tick-Tock joined the Night Shift to observe [[Moon Knight]]'s battle with the Shroud, as the Shroud tested him to serve as his replacement in the Night Shift.<ref>''Solo Avengers'' #3</ref>

After Digger was arrested by [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]], Tick-Tock joined the Night Shift in attacking the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] Compound, unaware that Mockingbird was no longer an Avenger. Tick-Tock helped the [[Brothers Grimm (comics)|Brothers Grimm]] defeat the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] by predicting when he would become solid, but the team was finally defeated by the Avengers. They were then rescued by the Shroud.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #40</ref>

When the [[Hangman (Marvel Comics)#Jason Roland|Hangman]] assumed control of the Night Shift, he encouraged each member to join him in a campaign of terror against Hollywood, pointing to their backgrounds for reasons why they should hate [[Hollywood]]. He noted that Tick-Tock had wanted to be a timer in an animation studio once. Tick-Tock joined the Night Shift in receiving new power from [[Satannish]], but lost a portion of their souls as a result. He accompanied the Night Shift as they captured [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], [[Julia Carpenter|Spider-Woman II]], and the [[U.S. Agent]], then attempted to offer their souls to Satannish.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #76</ref> [[Iron Man]] and [[Living Lightning]] followed Digger to the Tower of Shadows, and saved their teammates from the Night Shift. Tick-Tock attempted to defeat them with his new powers, slowing the Avengers down, but Spider-Woman was outside his path, and knocked him out from behind. They were teleported away from the Avengers by Dansen Macabre. Tick-Tock then joined the Night Shift in an attack on [[Wonder Man]], but found that Wonder Man was immune to his powers, possibly because of his ionic energies. After capturing Wonder Man, they were convinced by him to allow him to join them in their campaign against Hollywood by making their own film.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #77</ref>

When the U.S. Agent assumed the part Wonder Man had been playing in "The Demon That Devoured Hollywood", the Night Shift attacked him, and Tick-Tock slowed him down long enough for [[Misfit (Marvel Comics)|Misfit]], Digger and Hangman to knock him out. Realizing that Wonder Man intended to betray them, they also brought Wonder Man down.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #78</ref> As the Night Shift continued with their film project, the Avengers attacked them, all on film. The Night Shift nearly defeated them, but then learned from Dr. Strange that they had lost part of their souls to Satannish. They then turned on the Hangman, and helped the Avengers and [[Doctor Strange]] drive Satannish back to his own realm.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #79</ref>

Tick-Tock was with the Night Shift at the time when they are hired by the crime lord Snapdragon on [[Count Nefaria]]'s behalf to capture Moon Knight.<ref>''Moon Knight'' Vol. 7 #3</ref> When Moon Knight refused Tick-Tock's offer to accompany them, the Night Shift attacked where Tick-Tock accidentally hit Tatterdemalion when trying to shoot [[Echo (Marvel Comics)|Maya Lopez]]. After Echo knocked out Digger, she used a shovel to stab Tick-Tock. Moon Knight and Echo defeated the Night Shift who are then arrested by the police.<ref>''Moon Knight'' Vol. 7 #4</ref> As Tick-Tock was being interrogated by the LAPD's Detective Hall, Count Nefaria's lawyer showed up and ended the interrogation. After Count Nefaria's lawyer states that the Night Shift are victims of a beating from vigilantes, the Night Shift are released from police custody.<ref>''Moon Knight'' Vol. 7 #5</ref> When Tick-Tock and the rest of the Night Shift are brought before Snapdragon and Count Nefaria, the two of them wanted to discuss with them on why they failed their mission where Count Nefaria insulted them for their incompetence. Before the Night Shift can answer, Count Nefaria used his ionic energy blasts to incinerate them as he tells Snapdragon to aim a little higher the next time she asks for outside help.<ref>''Moon Knight'' Vol. 7 #6</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Tick-Tock can perceive various possible futures diverging within the next sixty seconds. The sharper his focus on a particular future event, the more likely it is to occur. He uses a pocket-watch to focus his power.

After being empowered by Satannish, Tick-Tock could control time causing people to freeze in place while he and his associates could move normally.{{issue|date=September 2017}}
