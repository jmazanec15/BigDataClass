==Fictional character biography==
Sometime after taking over as the CEO of [[Cross Technological Enterprises]] after his father's death, Cross attended an event called the 24th annual Conclave of Electronics Engineers and Innovators where Cross rubbed shoulders with representatives of various companies like [[Stark Industries]], [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], Cordco, and [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon]].

Years later, Augustine resurfaced and kidnapped Dr. Erica Sondheim to transplant a new heart into his cryogenically-preserved father's body.<ref>''Ant-Man'' Vol 2 #3</ref> Enlisting Crossfire's aid, Cross has [[Cassandra Lang|Cassie Lang]] kidnapped, believing the girl's Pym Particle-irradiated heart could sustain Darren's condition.<ref>''Ant-Man'' Vol 2 #4</ref> After [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Ant-Man]] and Darren were engaged in combat while Sondheim transplants another heart to Cassie, Augustine arrives to transport Darren to ultimately flee when the Pym Particles now within in his father's body caused Darren to shrink down.<ref>''Ant-Man'' Vol. 2 #5</ref>

In light of Darren refusing to invest in [[Power Broker]]'s Hench App, Augustine had temporarily hired [[Machinesmith]] to hack into Power Broker Inc.'s database so that Cross Technological Enterprises could steal its algorithm so that it can be used to create a Hench App knock-off called "Lackey".<ref>''Astonishing Ant-Man'' #2</ref>
