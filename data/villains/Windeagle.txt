==Fictional character biography==
Hector Santiago Ruiz was the only son of immigrants from the Dominican Republic, and he joined a local street gang after they came to New York and then became an armed robber. He was sent to prison on an assault charge, and there met visitors from a street mission, the Spiritual Light Society (apparently another name for the Dragon Circle), who gained custody of him when he went on parole.<ref name="Marvel Premiere #52">''Marvel Premiere'' #52 (February 1980)</ref>

Windeagle attacked the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] as he was investigating the death of Angela Lynne, and the possible involvement of the organization called the Dragon Circle. As they struggled, members of the Dragon Circle ambushed the Black Panther, and ran him down with their car.  They strapped the Black Panther down to a water wheel, intending to kill him; he broke free and Windeagle confronted him once more.<ref>''Jungle Action'' #24 (November 1976)</ref>

Some time later, Windeagle followed Monica Lynne and Kevin Trublood as they came to Manhattan to find out what had happened to the Black Panther.<ref>''Black Panther'' #14-15 (March-May 1979)</ref> Windeagle confronted and attacked the Black Panther at the Wakandan embassy.  The Black Panther was able to fight him off, and Taku and the Black Panther's agents captured Windeagle in a net. Windeagle escaped by gassing his guards, and attacked the Black Panther again, but as they fought a sniper across the street shot and killed Windeagle.<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #51 (December 1979)</ref>

An autopsy was performed on Windeagle and his past was investigated.<ref name="Marvel Premiere #52"/>

==Powers and abilities==
The Dragon Circle outfitted Windeagle with [[Wakanda (comics)|Wakandan]] technology enabling him to fly and glide along the winds.

His gloves contain knockout gas which he mostly uses to keep others from interfering.
