'''Ahab''' ('''Dr. Roderick "Rory" Campbell'''), a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
{{expand-section|date=December 2017}}
Based upon [[Herman Melville]]'s [[Captain Ahab (Moby-Dick)|Captain Ahab]],{{cn|date=December 2017}} but also named after [[Stan Lee]]'s childhood friend Rory Campbell from Portland, Oregon,{{cn|date=December 2017}} Ahab is a [[cyborg]]. Ahab's first appearance was a [[cameo appearance|cameo]] in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four Annual]]'' #23, as part of the "[[Days of Future Present]]" storyline.

==Fictional character biography==
In his future timeline, Ahab was the master of the [[Hounds (comics)|Hounds]], [[mind control]]led [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] who hunted down other mutants for Ahab and his masters, the [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]]. One of the Hounds, [[Rachel Summers]], escaped from him and eventually [[time travel]]led to the present. Ahab followed her to the past and was defeated by the [[X-Men]], [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], the [[New Mutants]] and the [[Fantastic Four]] during the "[[Days of Future Present]]" [[fictional crossover|crossover]].<ref>Fantastic Four Annual #23, X-Factor Annual #5, New Mutants Annual #6, Uncanny X-Men Annual #14</ref>

Later issues of ''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' revealed that scientist Rory Campbell was the man who would become Ahab in the future.{{issue|date=October 2014}} Campbell learned of this in the present and tried to prevent this fate, but he was eventually merged with his future self.{{issue|date=October 2014}} The merged Ahab joined the [[Four Horsemen of Apocalypse (comics)|Four Horsemen]] of the immortal supervillain [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]], taking up the position of "Famine" within that group.{{issue|date=October 2014}} He aided in the capture of several of [[Apocalypse (comics)#The Twelve|The Twelve]],{{issue|date=October 2014}} before being sent into an alternate dimension by [[Mikhail Rasputin]].{{issue|date=October 2014}}

In the not too distant future, he captured then killed [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] (who is immortal).{{issue|date=October 2014}} He worked beside an armored figure, with light coming from his left eye. Due to time travel, it is not known at what point in Ahab's life this was.<ref>''Cable'' #71</ref>

Ahab joined the Red Skull as one of his [[S-Men]] to fulfill his role during World War Hate.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #23</ref>

During the ''[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]'' storyline, Ahab was present when Magneto killed the S-Men.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #25</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Ahab can generate powerful energy harpoons that are formed from, and attached to, his own life force. Anyone who attempts to grab a harpoon gets burned. Each harpoon is keyed to its target's genetic structure, and cannot be moved or deflected by energy; it only stops when it strikes its target, or a close blood relative thereof. A hit from one of these harpoons can kill or seriously injure the target. A person who survives finds their neural pathways burned out and unable to move.

Ahab is a cyborg. His limbs are mostly of artificial construction and presumably this makes him superhumanly strong. So far he has found no need to engage in hand-to-hand combat due to his ability to use ranged attacks, his Hounds, and giant androids. He is largely immune to telepathic intrusion and attack, even from telepaths as powerful as [[Rachel Summers]]. Ahab's technology allows him to track, clothe and control [[Hounds (comics)|Hounds]].

As Famine, Ahab drains his victims' lifeforce resulting in emaciation and worse.

==Intended origin==
Ahab has the same cybernetic eye and marks over his other eye as [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], and the same streak of silver hair as [[Nate Grey]]. It was hinted early on in "Days of the Future Present" that Cable and Ahab may be the same person, but with the introduction of [[Stryfe]] and [[Nate Grey|X-Man]] (both versions of Cable), Marvel dropped that idea.{{cn|date=December 2017}}
