'''Phaeder''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is the father of [[Maelstrom (comics)|Maelstrom]].

==Publication history==
Phaeder first appeared in ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'' #72 and was created by [[Mark Gruenwald]], [[Ralph Macchio (comics)|Ralph Macchio]], and [[Ron Wilson (comics)|Ron Wilson]].

==Fictional character biography==
Phaeder was an [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] [[geneticist]]. Approximately a century ago, Phaeder was exiled from Attilan for daring to suggest the possibility of cloning. [[Agon (comics)|Agon]], father of [[Black Bolt]], was part of the Inhuman council of genetics that exiled him. Phaeder then cloned himself, and slew the clone, to cover his tracks as he left his home.<ref name="Marvel Two-in-One #72">''Marvel Two-in-One'' #72</ref>

Phaeder took up residence with the [[Deviant (comics)|Deviants]] in [[Lemuria (comics)|Lemuria]], where he mated with a Deviant named Morga who gave birth to [[Maelstrom (comics)|Maelstrom]]. When Maelstrom's paternity was discovered, Morga was put to death and Maelstrom was put in the Deviants's slave pits. Eventually, Phaeder rescued Maelstrom and brought him back to his secret laboratory in the ruins of Attilan. Together, they took Phaeder's research even farther: they perfected a technique for cheating death by transferring one's mind to a cloned body, a technique utilized multiple times by the [[Red Skull]].<ref name="Marvel Two-in-One #72"/>

It was later revealed that Phaeder had given the blueprints to break the genetic code to Herbert Wyndham which led to him becoming the [[High Evolutionary]].<ref>''X-Factor Annual'' #3</ref> Phaeder later contacted the High Evolutionary where he gave him some Subterraneans to use as slaves.<ref>''Silver Surfer Annual'' #4</ref>

Phaeder and Maelstrom later approached [[Arnim Zola]] where they deciphered and added to the genetic engineering notes that Arnim Zola obtained.<ref>''FF: Fifty Years'' #1</ref>

Obtaining Terrigen molecules from the underground caverns where Attilan used to be positioned, Phaeder established a sanctuary. He and Maelstrom gained human allies in order to reap from their research's benefits. These research benefits include the [[Enclave (comics)|Enclave]]'s Wladyslav Shinsky (whom they helped to build the Citadel of Science), [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]], and [[Doctor Hydro]] (where they gave him a Terrigen-deprived compound that was used to make the Hydro-Men).<ref name="Marvel Two-in-One #72"/>

Phaeder and Maelstrom were revealed to have a secret laboratory in the [[Carlsbad Caverns National Park]] where [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] created [[Alpha the Ultimate Mutant]].<ref>''Defenders'' #15</ref>

Eventually, Phaeder grew too old and decrepit to survive a soul transfer. Maelstrom tended to him while carrying out his own research. After Maelstrom's agents stole technology from the Inhumans that would've undone Doctor Hydro's experiment, their base was invaded by the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], [[Black Bolt]] and others. Maelstrom died in his sleep. Unable to escape, Maelstrom ordered [[Deathurge]] to slay him. Maelstrom survived by transferring to a new body, but Phaeder died during the process.<ref name="Marvel Two-in-One #72"/>

==Powers and abilities==
Phaeder is an expert geneticist and is good at making clones.
