'''Solarr''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Solarr first appeared in ''Captain America'' #160 and was created by [[Steve Englehart]] and [[Sal Buscema]].

==Fictional character biography==
Silas King was born in [[Carson City, Nevada]]. He was a latent [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|Mutant]] who worked as a smuggler of illicit narcotics. On a drug run from New York City to Los Angeles, his van broke down in the [[Mojave Desert]]. Trying to make his way back to civilization, King spent several days out in the desert sun, which catalyzed his latent mutation. While recovering from sunstroke and dehydration in the hospital, he realized he could discharge the solar energy he had stored as heat blasts.

Calling himself Solarr, he began a criminal career in New York City by starting with bank robbery. This activity brought him into partnership with [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]], and membership in the [[Emissaries of Evil]] led by [[Egghead (Marvel Comics)|Egghead]].<ref>''Alpha Flight Special'' #1</ref> 

Solarr later battled [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and [[Spider-Man]] when he was hired to kill a more hitman. The duo defeated Solarr, though the hitman went insane.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' vol.1 #123</ref>

He repeatedly met defeat, and was eventually captured and imprisoned at the [[Project Pegasus]] research center in New York State, where scientists studied his powers.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #57-58</ref><ref>''Dazzler'' #9</ref>

One of the other captives and subjects for study at Project Pegasus was [[Bres (comics)|Bres]], a member of the other-dimensional [[Fomor (comics)|Fomor]]. Bres began to use his powers to manipulate the staff at the facility, and caused a guard named Harry Winslow to die of heart failure. Bres also freed Solarr from his cell. Solarr hated Winslow, and when he found his corpse he incinerated it. Bres used his magic to animate the charred corpse, which killed Solarr.<ref>''Power Man & Iron Fist'' vol.1 #113</ref>

It was later revealed that Solarr was one of the possible targets of [[Scourge of the Underworld]], until Scourge found out that Solarr was already dead.<ref>''Captain America'' vol.1 #320</ref>
