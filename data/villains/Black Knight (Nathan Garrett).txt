'''Nathan Garrett''', also known as the criminal '''[[Black Knight (comics)|Black Knight]]''', is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He was a [[supervillain]] and descendant of [[Black Knight (Sir Percy)|the original Black Knight]], and was created by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist and co-plotter [[Dick Ayers]].

==Publication history==
[[Black Knight (Sir Percy)|Sir Percy]]'s descendant, Professor Nathan Garrett, debuted as the modern-day supervillain Black Knight in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' vol. 1, #52 (Feb. 1964). This villainous Black Knight appeared in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' vol. 1, #6, 14-15 (July 1964, Marchâ€“April 1965), and in the feature "[[Iron Man]]" in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' vol. 1, #73 (Jan. 1966), in which he was mortally wounded.

==Fictional character biography==
Professor Nathan Garrett is the distant direct descendant of Sir Percy, and was born in [[London, England]]. He becomes a biologist, research scientist, and university professor. He then became the head of an espionage ring, and was captured by the hero [[Hank Pym|Giant-Man]]. Garrett fled to Europe, where he found Sir Percy's tomb and the [[Ebony Blade]]. Garrett's evil tendencies make him unworthy of wielding the sword, and he is shunned by Sir Percy's ghost. An embittered Garrett then devises an arsenal of medieval weapons that employ modern technology (including a lance that fired bolts of energy) and genetically engineers and creates a winged horse called [[Aragorn (comics)|Aragorn]]. Calling himself the Black Knight, Garrett embarks on a career as a professional criminal to spite his ancestor. He battled Giant-Man again and the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] but is defeated.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' vol. 1 #52</ref>

Garrett joins the supervillain team the [[Masters of Evil]] at the request of master villain [[Baron Zemo#Heinrich Zemo|Baron Zemo]], and spread Adhesive X over the city. However, with the help of jailed villain [[Trapster|Paste-Pot Pete]], the Avengers find an antidote and the Teen Brigade apply it to the containers, causing it to free people. The Black Knight is defeated by Thor, as Captain America had decided to catch the Masters off guard by the Avengers 'switching' foes.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 1 #6</ref> He later attacked Stark Industries' plant to lure the hero [[Iron Man]] into battle, and was defeated.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #59</ref> Alongside the Master of Evil, he again battled the Avengers and is captured.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 1 #15-16</ref>  The Black Knight was among the villains assembled by [[Doctor Doom]] to destroy the [[Fantastic Four]].<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' #3</ref>

Garrett kidnaps [[Happy Hogan (comics)|Happy Hogan]] and falls from his winged horse while trying to kill Iron Man.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' vol. 1 #73</ref> Mortally wounded, a dying Garrett summons his nephew [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Dane Whitman]] to their family estate and reveals his secret identity and repents for his life of crime. Dane Whitman then decides to adopt the identity of the Black Knight himself.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 1 #48</ref>

After his death, Garrett is resurrected by [[Immortus]] as a member of the [[Legion of the Unliving]].  He battled Hank Pym once more, and "dies" again.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #61</ref> His horse is found by Victoria Frankenstein, great-granddaughter of Victor Frankenstein (creator of [[Frankenstein's Monster (Marvel Comics)|the Frankenstein Monster]]), who, using her ancestor's methods, tried to restore it to normal, but instead only mutated it further. Now called the Hellhorse, it later became the property of the supervillain Dreadknight.<ref>''Iron Man'' #101</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Nathan Garrett was a normal man with gifted intelligence. He had a Ph.D. in genetics, and was a brilliant biologist specializing in genetic engineering, and was a skilled electrical engineer as well.

Garrett created a power-lance which fired heat beams, electrical charges, and concussive electromagnetic force beams. He also used a rope as a lasso, steel cables as bolas, red-hot spinning metal discs, and electrical energy-drainers which resembled doughnuts. He carried a paralyzer pistol which fired nerve gas which could paralyze or kill an opponent.  He wore body armor made of an unknown steel alloy.

He was a skilled equestrian, and rode a winged flying horse that he created by genetic engineering.
