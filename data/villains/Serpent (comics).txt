'''Serpent''' ('''Cul Borson''') is a fictional supervillain appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Usually depicted as a foe of Odin and Thor, the Serpent has also come into conflict with the Avengers. He is the brother of Odin, therefore the uncle of Thor, Loki and [[Angela (comics)| Angela]]. He is known as the Norse '''God of Fear''', who is destined to kill Thor in one of the prophecies of [[Ragnarok]].

==Publication history==
Serpent first appeared in ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' #1 and was created by [[Stuart Immonen]] and [[Matt Fraction]].

==Fictional character biography==
Cul Borson is an enigmatic being who claims that he is the true All-Father of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] and not his brother [[Odin (comics)|Odin]]. After being injured upon falling off a peak, Cul crawled into the nearby [[Giants (Marvel Comics)|Giants]] camp and slaughtered them leaving a message stating "Gods do not live in the sky. We live on the Earth. And you do so at our pleasure." Following the death of his father Bor, Cul became the new All-Father and promised to keep his younger brothers Odin, Vili, and Ve as his trusted council. However, Cul did not stick to his word and used his Draumar{{what|date=April 2017}} to spread fear all over the Nine Realms. Cul's brothers worked to stop the beasts that Cul released on Aesheim, but Cul confronted them telling them to go home and allow him to rule. When Odin later confronted Cul, he deemed himself the Serpent as Odin fought him. As Odin was unable to kill Serpent, he sealed him away in an underwater prison and kept his existence a secret.<ref name="Fear Itself #4">''Fear Itself'' #4</ref>

Thousands of years later during the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Serpent was freed from his underwater prison by [[Red Skull]]'s daughter [[Sin (Marvel Comics)|Sin]] who possesses the Hammer of Skadi. Upon emerging as an old man, Serpent prepared Skadi's forces and calls the Hammers of the Worthy which he sends to Earth so that whoever acquires them would help him cause fear and chaos across the globe. This causes some characters on Earth to become his Worthy. [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] becomes Kuurth: Breaker of Stone, [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] becomes Nul: Breaker of Worlds, [[Attuma]] becomes Nerkodd: Breaker of Oceans, [[Titania (Marvel Comics)|Titania]] becomes Skirn: Breaker of Men, [[Grey Gargoyle]] becomes Mokk: Breaker of Faith, [[Absorbing Man]] becomes Greithoth: Breaker of Wills, and [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] becomes Angrir: Breaker of Souls.<ref>''Fear Itself'' #1</ref> As the Worthy wreaked havoc across the globe, Serpent rejuvenated himself with the collected fears and assumed a younger state in addition to his staff assuming the shape of a hammer. Afterwards, Serpent started forming the Dark Asgard in [[Antarctica]] with a 1,000-eyed creature acting as his [[Heimdall (comics)|Heimdall]]. Upon tracing the Serpent's location, [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] started to head to Dark Asgard as the 1,000-eyed creature alerted Serpent of this. Serpent dispatched his forces to greet Thor after which the Serpent revealed to Thor that a prophecy stated that it was indeed Serpent who Thor slays and dies as a result, not the [[Midgard Serpent (Marvel Comics)|Midgard Serpent]]. Further revealing relation to Odin as his brother and Thor as his nephew, Serpent tried to convince Thor to join him in his cause which Thor promptly refused. This forces Serpent to teleport Thor away to where two of his Worthy (Nul: Breaker of Worlds and Angrir: Breaker of Souls) were waiting to battle the Thunderer.<ref name="Fear Itself #4"/> Serpent later teleported himself to where Skadi was fighting the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. During his battle with the Avengers, Serpent managed to push them back and intercept [[Captain America]]'s shield attack where he managed to break it with his fists. Serpent then raised his hammer and obliterated it in a devastating attack before teleporting away.<ref>''Fear Itself'' #5</ref> In an attempt to destroy Odin and his followers, Serpent and his followers headed to [[Broxton, Oklahoma]] in order to use Heimdall's Observatory to travel to Asgard.<ref>''Fear Itself'' #6</ref> After Thor was healed and returned from Asgard, Serpent switched to a giant serpent form and battled his nephew while the Avengers fought the Worthy with the weapons that [[Iron Man]] made in Asgard's workshops. At the end, Thor slew his uncle with Odinsword (revealed to be Ragnarok) and died in the arms of Odin thus fulfilling the prophecy.<ref>''Fear Itself'' #7</ref> Following Thor's funeral, Odin took Serpent's corpse to Asgard, cast out the other [[Asgardians]], and locked himself alone with the body until the end of time while blaming himself for not preventing Thor's death.<ref>''Fear Itself'' #8</ref>

During the ''[[Original Sin (comics)|Original Sin]]'' storyline, Serpent was revived by Odin as he is contacted by [[Loki (comics)|Loki]].<ref>''Original Sin'' #5.4</ref>

Serpent later repented his sins, was pardoned by Odin as a reformed God, and was made Royal [[Inquisitor]] and [[Justice ministry|Minister of Justice]].<ref>''Thor'' Vol. 4 #5</ref> Serpent's first task as the Royal Inquisitor is to retrieve Mjolnir from the [[Jane Foster (comics)|female Thor]]. While using the [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]] armor, Serpent confronted her as she was about to take action against [[Malekith the Accursed]] and [[Minotaur (comics)|Minotaur]].<ref>''Thor'' Vol. 4 #6</ref> Serpent managed to briefly reclaim Mjolnir until Thor managed to call it back to her. Thor continued her fight against Serpent until she received aid from Thor Odinson, Freya, and an army of women that Thor Odinson suspected of being the female Thor.<ref>''Thor'' Vol. 4 #7</ref> After a fierce battle, Freya convinced Odin to call off Serpent's mission by mocking him.<ref>''Thor'' Vol. 4 #8</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Serpent possesses the known abilities of the Asgardians which are superior due to him being the son of Bor. He possesses superhuman strength (which is enough to shatter Captain America's shield with his bare hands), speed, agility, stamina and durability, a healing factor, longevity, shape-shifting, and magic manipulation. Serpent can also eat fear in order to empower himself.
