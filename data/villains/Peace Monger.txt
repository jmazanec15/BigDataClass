'''Peace Monger''' ('''Dr. Cobbleskill''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] in the [[Marvel Universe]]. His first appearance was in ''Marvel Comics Presents #27''.

==Fictional character biography==
During a fund-raising dinner, Dr. Cobbleskill was attacked by a group calling themselves the Knights of Saint Virgil. They meant to kill him, yet he stopped his bodyguards from acting. The [[American Eagle (Marvel Comics)|American Eagle]] pulled the rug from under the knights. Cobbleskill wanted to punish the men himself, but American Eagle stopped him and left with the newspaper columnist [[Joanna Cargill]]. Later, at a rally in front of the Washington Monument, Cobbleskill led the crowd's emotions to a fever pitch. Joanna Cargill appeared, revealing Cobbleskill's forgery of the attack by the Knights of Saint Virgil, Cobbleskill attacked her physically. When the American Eagle showed up, Cobbleskill had fully transformed into the Peace Monger. A physical dispute followed, which the Peace Monger lost (the crowd's hatred turned to betrayal and confusion, as the Eagle put it), as well as an intellectual debate on fighting prejudice and oppression. Cobbleskill's powers depleted, the American Eagle carried him to the police.{{issue|date=August 2012}}

Years later, Dr. Cobbleskill incited riots in [[Brooklyn]], employing gang members to stir up trouble against other ethnic groups, so he could feed off the hate they would generate amongst one another. An assault upon Korean shop-owners was broken up by the [[U.S. Agent]], who followed gang-member Luis back to the Peace Monger, and fought him. The Peace Monger attempted to feed off the hate of the U.S. Agent himself in order to power-up, but to his horror, found the U.S. Agent was above something as trivial as hate. His own power vanished, leaving him a small, weak man, who the U.S. Agent easily clocked with a single punch.{{issue|date=August 2012}}
