'''Polestar''' is the name used by a pair of fictional characters appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The characters are usually depicted as mercenaries and antagonists of [[Spider-Man]], closely associated with the [[Great Game (comics)|Great Game]]. The first is currently deceased.

==Fictional character biography==

===Polestar I===
Polestar's costume and gauntlets gave him significant control over various magnetic properties.  Personality wise, he seemed obsessed with corporate business stratagems and lingo, seeming for all intents and purposes to be a glorified corporate yuppie answering to his financial backers in the Great Game.

Thomas Duffy, the original Polestar, battled [[Kaine Parker|Kaine]] in his first appearance.{{Issue|date=May 2010}} Polestar is notable for having aided fellow Spider-Man enemy and Great Game player [[El Toro Negro]] in killing the Marvel Comics hero [[Nightwatch (comics)|Nightwatch]].  During an attempt to kidnap the son of Nightwatch's ex-girlfriend (the boy having been declared a prize in the Great Game), Duffy used his suit's powers to peel back Nightwatch's costume (composed of [[Nanorobotics|nanites]]) long enough for El Toro Negro to shoot the hero directly in his exposed chest.

Unfortunately for Polestar, El Toro Negro then immediately turned on him, placing a gun between his eyes and shooting him point blank in the head.{{Issue|date=May 2010}}

===Polestar II===
A man named Patrick Trettel soon found sponsorship in the Great Game as the second Polestar, and was seen alongside [[Joystick (comics)|Joystick]] battling the new [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] in '''''New Thunderbolts''''' #2.<ref>''New Thunderbolts'' #2</ref>
