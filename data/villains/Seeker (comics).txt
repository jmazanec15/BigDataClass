Hanson.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Inhumans Among Us|series=Avengers Assemble|network=Disney XD|season=3|number=9|airdate=July 24, 2016}}</ref> He was on an Inhuman ship that was carrying the Alpha Primitives when it suddenly crashes into the mountains of Maple Falls dispensing the Terrigen Fog onto the town which drove the Alpha Primitives crazy. When the Avengers and the Inhumans arrived, Seeker apologized to Black Bolt for what happened to the Inhuman ship. While the Avengers were fighting the Inhumans, Seeker monitored a Terrigen cocoon that was inside a building until [[Inferno (Dante Pertuz)|Inferno]] hatched from it. He was present when the Avengers and the Inhumans used a device to disperse the Terrigen Fog where the Alpha Primitives and Inferno were back to acting like themselves. It was later revealed that Seeker was in collaboration with Ultron to have the Inhuman ship crash. Seeker tells Ultron that the device he has built for him is almost complete. In the episode "The Inhuman Condition," Seeker was with Black Bolt when Lockjaw brings the Avengers to Attilan during Ultron's invasion. While in an underground lab, Seeker revealed that Inferno's Terrigenesis is the result of him being an Inhuman descendant. He has also invented a device that would dispense the Terrigen Mist to Earth where those who are Inhuman descendants of Inhumans would go through their Terrigenesis. When Ultron arrives, Seeker learns too late that he was tricked into helping Ultron. Ultron then hooks up to Seeker's device and uses it to phase-shift Seeker away.
