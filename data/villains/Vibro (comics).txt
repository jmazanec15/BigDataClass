==Fictional character biography==
Alton Vibreaux was born in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]]. Working as a seismologist and engineer, he fell into the San Andreas Fault during the test of his experimental apparatus, giving him superhuman powers. He sought vengeance on his employer Franklin Fortney, and battled [[War Machine|James Rhodes]] as the second Iron Man.<ref>''Iron Man'' (vol. 1) #186-187</ref> He battled Rhodes again, but was defeated by Tony Stark wearing the original [[Iron Man]] [[Iron Man's armor|armor]].<ref>''Iron Man'' (vol. 1) #191-192</ref> Alongside the [[Griffin (Marvel Comics)|Griffin]], he attempted an escape from the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]], and encountered the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] and [[Nomad (comics)|Nomad]].<ref>''Captain America'' #340</ref> Vibro caused a massive earthquake in Los Angeles, and battled the [[West Coast Avengers|Avengers West Coast]],<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #58</ref> and later battled the original [[Iron Man]] again.<ref>''Iron Man'' (vol. 1) #267</ref>

Vibro was killed and resurrected by the [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]] and joined an assault on the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] [[helicarrier]] which resulted in its destruction.<ref>''Wolverine'' (vol. 3) #26-27</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Vibro gained superhuman powers when his nuclear-powered seismic energy absorption apparatus was grafted to his body; this apparatus has been transformed into a vibrational energy generator. Vibro has the ability to generate high-level seismic vibrations and fire them from his hands as vibratory or concussive force, causing shockwaves, opening chasms, and/or generating earthquakes. He can harness the energy of his vibratory force emissions for flight at subsonic speeds, and he has the ability to generate shields of vibratory force around himself. Vibro is immune to the effects of his own powers.

Vibro is mentally unstable due to the traumatic accident that gave him his powers; he also suffered acute facial disfigurement and scalp damage. His powers decrease in magnitude as his distance from the San Andreas Fault increases.

Vibro wears body armor of an unknown composition and synthetic stretch fabric.

Anton Vibreaux has a [[Ph.D.]] in geological engineering.
