'''Perrikus''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appears in ''Thor'' vol. 2, #1 (July 1998) and was created by [[Dan Jurgens]] and [[John Romita Jr]].

==Publication history==
Perrikus first appeared in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' vol. 2, #1 (July 1998), and made brief appearances in ''Thor'' #4-5 (Oct. - Nov. 1998) until an extended storyline in ''Thor'' #7-12 (Jan. - June 1999). Perrikus returned to Marvel continuity in ''Thor'' #42 - 43 (Dec. 2001 - Jan. 2002) and #53 (Oct. 2002).

==Fictional character biography==
Perrikus first appears when accidentally freed from a prison in [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] by the Thunder God [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. Not knowing what has occurred, Thor departs and Perrikus joins with other entities revealed to be his brethren, the [[Dark Gods (comics)|Dark Gods]]. With an army they invade and overrun Asgard, capturing [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]], Thor's father and the ruler of the [[Norse paganism|Norse]] gods.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #1 (July 1998)</ref> 

Perrikus is revealed to hate the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardians]] as over a millennium ago an Asgardian scout called Lonkarr found and investigated the city of the Dark Gods. While there, Lonkarr was attacked by Tserron - the wife of Perrikus - whom he killed in combat. Perrikus then led the Dark Gods after Lonkarr to Asgard where the two factions entered into a full-scale war. Although thwarted, Perrikus still wishes revenge against Odin by killing the now-adult Thor, and during single combat slices Thor's hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]] in half with his own weapon.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2 #4-5 (Oct.-Nov. 1998)</ref> Despite this setback, Thor regroups and, with the aid of fellow immortal [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] and the Asgardian [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]], defeats Perrikus and the Dark Gods.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2 #7-12 (Jan.-June 1999)</ref>

When [[Desak]] the God Slayer slaughters the Dark Gods, only Perrikus and Adva (God of Portals and Knowledge) escape.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #42 - 43 (Dec. 2001 - Jan. 2002)</ref> The pair eventually battle Thor at the direction of [[Zarrko]] the Tomorrow Man, although both concede defeat when Thor severs Perrikus's right arm with the [[Bloodaxe (comics)|Bloodaxe]]. Perrikus and Adva retreat.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #53 (Oct. 2002)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Referred to as the God of Unlimited Power and Infinite Energy, Perrikus possesses superhuman strength, durability and endurance. The character possesses advanced fighting skills and a magical [[scythe]] capable of energy projection and, apparently, damaging Thor's hammer Mjolnir.
