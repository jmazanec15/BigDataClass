'''Typhoid Mary''' ('''Mary Walker'''), also known as '''Bloody Mary''' and '''Mutant Zero''', is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was initially depicted as an enemy of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], but has also come into conflict with [[Spider-Man]] and [[Deadpool]].

==Publication history==
Typhoid Mary first appeared in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #254, and was created by [[Ann Nocenti]] and [[John Romita, Jr.]]  Her name comes from early 20th-century Irish-American cook and [[typhoid fever]] carrier [[Mary Mallon|"Typhoid Mary" Mallon]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.comicvine.com/typhoid-mary/4005-1536/issues-cover/ |title=Typhoid Mary |publisher=Comic Vine |date= |accessdate=2014-04-29}}</ref>

She first appeared as Mutant Zero in ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #4 as a member of [[Henry Peter Gyrich]]'s [[Black operation|black ops]] team but she was eventually revealed to be this character. Prior to this, writer [[Dan Slott]] stated that the "mysterious character" was secretly a well-known character in disguise.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=127995|title=Dan Slott: Taking The Initiative - Newsarama|publisher=Forum.newsarama.com|date=|accessdate=2011-02-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619222924/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=127995|archivedate=2009-06-19|df=}}</ref>{{quote|She's a mutant chick who's been cover-worthy many times...

==Fictional character biography==
Typhoid Mary is an enemy and former lover of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] with low level psionic powers, including [[psychokinesis|telekinesis]]. She has been a professional criminal employed by [[organized crime]] syndicates as an [[assassination|assassin]] in the past. She is also gravely [[mental illness|mentally ill]].

Her condition was accidentally caused when Matt Murdock had tracked a villain down to the brothel where Mary worked. Matt attacked the man, but surprisingly, the girls working there came towards.{{huh?|date=August 2017}} Panicking, Matt lashed out, knocking Mary out of the window. It was at this moment that she somehow became "Typhoid Mary" and vows no man would ever hurt her again.<ref>''Deadpool/Daredevil Annual'' 1997</ref> In later appearances, however, she would imply that she was a victim of [[child abuse]].{{Issue|date=May 2009}} <ref>''Typhoid'' Feb. 1996</ref>

Suffering from [[dissociative identity disorder]], Mary Walker has three other abnormal personalities in addition to her seemingly healthy one. Her "Mary" personality is a timid, quiet, [[pacifism|pacifist]]; her "Typhoid" personality is adventurous, lustful, and violent; and her "Bloody Mary" persona is brutal, [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]], and misandrous. Mary once claimed that there was a fourth personality who is 'lost' but has not since been mentioned. Aside from highly developed [[martial arts]] skills, she also possesses telekinetic powers and, more dangerously, [[pyrokinesis]], the ability to set people or objects in her immediate vicinity aflame.

In her first appearance, she met Murdock, and was hired as an assassin by the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #254</ref> She then first battled Daredevil, while beginning a romance with Murdock.<ref>''Daredevil'' #255</ref> She temporarily reverted to her "Mary" personality,<ref>''Daredevil'' #256</ref> but then reverted to her "Typhoid" personality, and began a romance with the Kingpin.<ref>''Daredevil'' #257</ref> She hired [[Bullet (comics)|Bullet]], [[Bushwacker (comics)|Bushwacker]], [[Ammo (comics)|Ammo]], and the [[Wildboys (comics)|Wild Boys]] to attack Daredevil,<ref>''Daredevil'' #258</ref> and then personally led these criminals against the blind vigilante.<ref>''Daredevil'' #260</ref>

A favorite pawn of the Kingpin, Typhoid frequently battled and had a [[love-hate relationship]] with Daredevil before disappearing. Through [[hypnosis]], the abnormal and [[psychosis|psychotic]] personalities were suppressed from Walker's consciousness, and she began to lead a normal life, becoming an actress on a [[soap opera]].{{Issue|date=May 2009}} She was sent by [[Doctor Doom]] to learn the secrets of [[Kymellian]] technology from [[Power Pack]] during the [[Acts of Vengeance]].<ref>''Power Pack'' #53</ref> She was subsequently in the Kingpin's employ once again, and met [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]].<ref>''Captain America'' #373</ref> She helped thwart an attempt on the Kingpin's life by [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]].<ref>''Captain America'' #376</ref> At one point, as she struggled to keep her multiple personalities under control, she befriended [[Mary Jane Watson]] and battled [[Spider-Man]] when Bloody Mary resurfaced and she began killing men who committed [[domestic abuse]]. With the web-slinger's help, Mary regained control and voluntarily turned herself in to the police for treatment.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #214</ref>

At one point, Mary was confined to a mental institution where each personality hired a mercenary. Mary hired [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]] to kill her, Typhoid hired him to break her out, and Bloody Mary hired The [[Vamp (comics)|Vamp/Animus]] to break her out to resume a killing spree. Deadpool defeated the Vamp/Animus but refused to kill Mary, allowing the Typhoid personality to become dominant.<ref>''Deadpool'' Vol. 1 #6-7</ref>  Typhoid and Deadpool had a few adventures together, including traveling to New York City to confront Daredevil for accidentally kicking her out of the brothel some years ago (as she regained the memories of this incident when Deadpool pushed her out of a window), before Deadpool attempted to reform Typhoid. This did not go well and the two eventually separated after she seduced him while disguised as [[Siryn]].<ref>''Deadpool'' #13</ref>

However, following a series of events involving the Kingpin (fall from power, subsequent near-death [[coma]], recovery, rising back to power, and taking out enemies to retook the criminal empire),<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #46</ref> the Kingpin distracts Daredevil by paying a visit to Walker at her show and, with a blunt slap, released the abnormal personalities. Murdock's bodyguards [[Luke Cage]] and [[Jessica Jones]] managed to take her down after she confronted Daredevil's [[secret identity]] and set the man on fire. Mary was imprisoned on a [[The Raft (comics)|maximum security prison]] for super-powered criminals.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 1 #01</ref>

[[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] later led an attack on the Raft, breaking out the prisoners. While the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] arrived and managed to stop some of the prisoners, Mary managed to escape and was briefly mentioned as once more working for the Kingpin.<ref>''Civil War: War Crimes''</ref>

===The Initiative===
[[File:Mutantzero.PNG|thumb|upright|Mutant Zero, art by [[Stefano Caselli]].]]

At some point after the superhuman [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'s events, she is found by [[Henry Peter Gyrich]] and recruited into the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative]] program as "Mutant Zero", although her identity as Typhoid Mary was kept secret from her teammates. It's unknown whether she suffered some sort of psychotic episode which left her too unstable to be left to her own devices or whether she sought out treatment and joined of her own free will. Gyrich reveals that Mutant Zero is a mutant that not only remained empowered following [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], but one that is not included in the official record of the remaining mutants. Technically not existing in any official capacity, her true identity is made classified and she is given the Mutant Zero codename. According to [[Doc Samson|Dr. Leonard Samson]], Mutant Zero is still mentally unstable and that referencing any of her other identities could lead to a period of instability. Mutant Zero is inducted into the [[Shadow Initiative]] (the Initiative's black ops team), but she can only be 'activated' once per mission due to her mental instability.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #5</ref>

When [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] is appointed as the Shadow Initiative's field leader, Taskmaster senses something familiar about Mutant Zero's body language (thanks to Taskmaster's superhuman ability), and initiates an impromptu sparring match with her to satisfy this curiosity.  After witnessing her fighting style and provoking her into using her pyrokinesis, Taskmaster shatters her helmet's faceplate and reveals her true identity.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #20</ref>

As the Shadow Initiative prepares to capture [[Hardball (comics)|Hardball]] in [[Madripoor]], Mary reveals that the reason why she joined the Initiative is because she couldn't merge or block out her four personalities, so she offered to join in exchange for a pardon and to help integrate her fractured mind, which is still a work in progress.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #21</ref> During the Shadow Initiative's fight against [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]], Mary loses control of her personalities, having spent too much time from the Zero Room, and flees into the wilds of Madripoor.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #24</ref>

===Shadowland===
{{Main|Shadowland (comics)}}
Mary answers Daredevil's call for superheroes to join [[Hand (comics)|The Hand]] in providing [[martial law]] for an ever-increasing area of New York City. She claims that her time in the Initiative was successful in integrating her fractured mind, but Daredevil does not believe her.<ref>''Shadowland'' #3, September 2010</ref> Following the war, Kingpin - using secret code words to activate her fourth personality - reveals that she was an inside agent who was ignorant of her 'true' goal all along.<ref>''Shadowland'' #5, December 2010</ref>

===Sisterhood===
Typhoid Mary joins the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Sisterhood of Mutants]], as [[Lady Deathstrike]] promises to use Arkea to reintegrate Mary's personalities, which Arkea then does.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 4 #9</ref> The sisterhood, specifically Arkea and [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Amora]], resurrect [[Selene (comics)|Selene]] and [[Madelyne Pryor]]. But before the Sisterhood can recruit additional members and go on an offensive, the X-Men attack. Typhoid Mary is defeated by [[Psylocke]]. Arkea is killed, while Madelyne swears to maintain the Sisterhood and continue the war against the [[X-Men]].<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 4 #12</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Typhoid Mary is a mutant and possesses a number of limited psionic powers. She can use telekinesis to levitate small objects over short distances (such as weapons of under 10 pounds; knives, razors, etc., which her "Bloody Mary" persona often gathered and assembled into improvised battle-armor). She is a powerful pyrokinetic, meaning she can cause spontaneous combustion within line of sight to set objects in her immediate vicinity aflame. She can implant mental suggestions in the minds of others. She can use her psionic hypnosis ability to induce sleep in weak-minded individuals and most animals; certain individuals are mentally resistant to her hypnotic powers.

However, she has three [[Dissociative identity disorder|separate personalities]] as a result of her mental illness. The timid, pacifist "Mary" personality has no psionic abilities. The "Typhoid" and "Bloody Mary" personalities have the full range of these psionic powers and they are strongest in "Bloody Mary". Her original "Mary Walker" personality is supposed to be a balanced amalgam of all of these, but is seldom dominant. Because of the different heart rates and voice patterns of her different personas, not to mention the different ways of dress, even Daredevil's super-senses were long unable to tell the different personas all belonged to the same woman, and Typhoid Mary took advantage of this situation to hide from Daredevil/Matt Murdock even within earshot.

As Mutant Zero, Mary appears to possess the same psionic powers utilized by both Typhoid and Bloody Mary. It is unknown whether the powers she possesses as Mutant Zero are equal to or stronger than those of the "Bloody Mary" personality. Recent battles suggest they are more powerful, but take their toll on Mary when used as a result of this strength. Mutant Zero is also equipped with a suit of full body armor that appears to enhance her physical strength and an arsenal of weapons, including guns and various blades.

Typhoid Mary is in excellent physical condition. She has sufficient [[reflex]]es to block and redirect a bullet back at its shooter. She has peak human agility, and is highly athletic. She is also trained in the martial arts, particularly [[Judo]] and Kendo. She has exceptional skill in wielding and throwing bladed weapons, and is usually armed with a variety of machetes and smaller knives.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Typhoid Mary had a non-voiced cameo appearance in the 1990s ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' cartoon series.{{cn|date=August 2017}} In the episode "Beyond Good and Evil" [Pt. 3], she was seen as one of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]'s captured psychics (alongside [[Psylocke]], [[Oracle (Marvel Comics)|Oracle]], [[Moondragon]], [[Emma Frost]], [[Stryfe]], [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Jason Wyngarde]] and [[Rachel Summers]]).
* Typhoid Mary appears in ''[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers: Secret Wars]]'', voiced by [[Tara Strong]].<ref name="Prison Break">{{cite episode|title=Prison Break|serieslink=Avengers Assemble (TV series)|series=Avengers: Secret Wars|network=Disney XD|season=4|number=4|airdate=August 27, 2017}}</ref> In the episode "Prison Break", she teams up with [[Power Princess|Zarda]] and the [[Black Widow (Yelena Belova)|Crimson Widow]] to escape the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]]. However, they were defeated by the efforts of the [[Hope Pym|Wasp]] and [[Carol Danvers|Captain Marvel]].

===Film===
* Typhoid Mary appears in the 2005 film ''[[Elektra (2005 film)|Elektra]]'', portrayed by [[Natassia Malthe]].{{cn|date=August 2017}} This version's only real similarity she had to her comic book character is the name. In the film she is an assassin for the [[Hand (comics)|Hand]] whose breath or touch kills whatever they come into contact with. Her poison touch spreads throughout an area at will, killing life, and she can poison her weapons by breathing on them. The precise limitations to the poison that leaves her body is unknown, nor to how quickly and wide she can spread it. She was once a skilled ninja called the Treasure, and is jealous of Abby who is the new Treasure. Typhoid gives Elektra a poisonous kiss, which almost kills her. She succeeds in killing Abby with her breath-poisoned weapons, although Elektra later resurrects Abby with the same method that her master, [[Stick (comics)|Stick]], had used to revive her after she was killed by [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] in the 2003 film ''[[Daredevil (film)|Daredevil]]''. After Elektra kills [[Kirigi]] in a final battle, Elektra throws a sai through the hedges of a maze and straight into Typhoid's face. Typhoid falls back onto the ground and disintegrates. The character is specifically called "Typhoid Mary" rather than just Typhoid during the "Making of Elektra" feature on the DVD.

===Video games===
* Typhoid Mary appeared in the [[Sega CD]] video game ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin]]''. She was one of [[The Kingpin|Kingpin's]] personal bodyguards alongside [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]]. Both bodyguards must be defeated by [[Spider-Man]] before the web-slinger can reach Kingpin.
* Typhoid Mary made a cameo appearance in ''[[The Punisher (1990 computer game)|The Punisher]]'' DOS PC video game.{{cn|date=April 2017}} In the final mission, she's watching the Kingpin's departure from the crime lord's penthouse apartment's outdoor patio. During the [[Punisher]]'s optional chance to take out Typhoid Mary, her final words to Punisher are "Ha! You're too late! Kingpin just escaped! You'll never catch him, you lousy ?!&$*!? !!!!"
