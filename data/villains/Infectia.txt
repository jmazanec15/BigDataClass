==Fictional character biography==
Infectia was a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with the ability to perceive the molecular structure of living beings and induce [[mutation]]s in them by altering their [[gene]]tic makeup. She typically manifested her power by kissing her intended target. When used on baseline humans, this power caused them to become deformed monsters with superhuman strength and a fanatical loyalty to Infectia, who called them her "Anti-Bodies". Unfortunately these mutations were unstable, and the Anti-Bodies would spontaneously combust after a short time.

She was a skilled geneticist having picked up her skills from her father who was also a well known scientist who had made a lot of money from his research. Her mother appears to have died when Infectia was young and her father died whilst Infectia was in high school, leaving her his house and all his money. Infectia dropped out of school and started studying her powers. She started flirting with humans that wanted superpowers, (normally meeting them in bars). Infectia gave them super strength, by turning them into Anti-bodies, in return, they had to do something for her.

She originally appears as an adversary of [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]. Infectia wishes to take control of X-Factor's sentient headquarters [[Ship (comics)|Ship]]. She first gathers together some of her Anti-bodies and sent them to fight X-Factor. [[Jean Grey]] kills the three minions. She then decides to seduce and control [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] with her powers, but she didn't know exactly what would happen as she'd never tried her powers on another mutant. [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] foiled her plan when he intercepts a kiss intended for Iceman, which left Beast comatose. Other kisses meant for Iceman are foiled by a junior group of mutants, the [[X-Terminators]], who were also living aboard Ship. Ship himself tries to help out but is limited as he is vulnerable to Infectia's powers. She is ultimately defeated off-Ship.<ref>''X-Factor'' vol. 1 #29-31</ref>

When Beast recovers he regains his intelligence (which [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] had caused to fade) and his blue furry form as an effect of Infectia's powers.<ref>''X-Factor'' vol. 1 #33</ref> She later makes amends with Beast while dying from the [[Legacy Virus]]. Beast cares for Infectia in her final days.<ref>''X-Men'' #27 (December 1993)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Can psionically scan and visualize the molecular structures of living things, including her own, and then rearrange their physical forms with a touch in any way she can think
