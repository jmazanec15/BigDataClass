'''Fever Pitch''' is a fictional [[villain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is usually depicted as a member of the second incarnation of the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] terrorist organization [[Gene Nation]] and later as a member of [[X-Corps]]. He was one of the few Gene Nationals to make a sustained appearance outside of the group besides the various leaders: [[Marrow (comics)|Marrow]], [[Mikhail Rasputin]], [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]], and [[Dark Beast]].

==Publication history==
Fever Pitch first appeared in ''Generation X'' #50 and was created by [[Jay Faerber]] and [[Terry Dodson]].

==Fictional character biography==
In Fever Pitch's first appearance in ''[[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]]'' #50, he was a member of the incarnation of Gene Nation organized and led by the [[Dark Beast]]. He was ordered to capture the members of Generation X and successfully apprehended [[Chamber (comics)|Chamber]] and [[Skin (Marvel Comics)|Skin]]. Fever Pitch revealed a little about his past, namely when his powers first manifested, and he kept comparing himself to Chamber, much to his chagrin. In a similar fashion to Chamber, Fever Pitch blew off his face when his powers first activated and, over the years he had run out of skin to burn.

Later in ''[[X-Man]]'' #50, X-Man, [[Emma Frost|White Queen]], and the new student [[Gaia (Marvel Comics)|Gaia]] battle the collected Gene Nation to free the members of Generation X. In the ensuing fight, X-Man [[siphon]]s off Fever Pitch's energy, seemingly killing him.

===X-Corps===
However he resurfaced in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #402 in [[Berlin]].  The criminal is fighting [[Abyss (comics)|Abyss]] to try to capture him and sell him to researchers who wanted to [[dissection|dissect]] him. The battle is interrupted by [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]], [[Blob (comics)|Blob]], and [[Mystique (comics)|Surge]] of the X-Corps, a paramilitary facility run by the former X-Men [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee's]]. This group takes the two men prisoner. Once inside Banshee's facility, Fever Pitch is mind-controlled by the imprisoned [[Mastermind (Martinique Jason)|Martinique Jason]] into serving the X-Corps...or so it seems. When [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] reveals herself to have infiltrated the facility Fever Pitch joined her group of rebels on a rampage through [[Paris]] to show the populace the true face of mutants. The mutant rampage results in the destruction of the [[Eiffel Tower]]. Fever Pitch is about to burn down the [[Louvre]], but the timely arrival of the [[X-Men]] - specifically [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], thwarts his efforts with a large application of ice.

===The 198===
''X-Men: The 198 Files'' reveals that not only has he kept his powers after the "[[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]]" of the mutant population, but the government considers him a 'Severe' national security threat. For some time he lives in the tent city located on the grounds of the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]]. He is assigned to share a tent with [[Toad (comics)|Toad]], but he prefers the company of [[Morlocks (comics)|Erg]], [[Sack (comics)|Sack]], and [[Mammomax]]. He is one of the many mutants to have a "tracking" chip implanted in his head before a trip into the nearby town of Salem Center. When the chip's true nature is discovered he has it removed by [[Mister M (comics)|Mr. M]], whom he follows when he leads an exodus from the institute. During [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse's]] recent attack on the institute he is seen siding with Apocalypse along with [[Skids (comics)|Skids]] and Scalphunter inside the floating Sphinx.

Fever Pitch is one of the many mutants that revolts against Sentinel Squad O*N*E during [[Domino (comics)|Domino]] and [[Shatterstar]]'s successful attempt to release the mutants "relocated" at the Xavier Institute. Many of the mutants escape to further battles and confrontations.

===X-Force===
Fever Pitch was captured by the Purifiers and injected with a new form of the Legacy Virus. He was then pushed into a large crowd of anti-mutant protesters, where the Purifiers intended for him to lose control of his powers and make martyrs of the protesters. X-23 picked up the scent of his fire but as Fever Pitch began to scream, it was too late. His powers went nova, firing a massive wave that incinerated a large proportion of the crowd and himself. It is assumed that Fever Pitch did not survive the ordeal.

==Powers and abilities==
With the manifestation of his powers Fever Pitch was reduced to a flaming [[skeleton]]. He is capable of extending that biological flame outwards as intense heat, explosive blasts, or use it for flight. If, as he claims, his abilities are similar to [[Chamber (comics)|Chamber]]'s then he also does not have a need to eat, drink, or breathe oxygen.

==In other media==

===Television===
* Fever Pitch appeared in the ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' episode "Greetings from Genosha" voiced by [[Steven Blum]]. He is shown causing havoc and engaged Seamus Mellencamp and Mercury in battle. With Scarlet Witch's help, Nightcrawler defeated Fever Pitch and he was remanded to one of Magneto's cells. In "Foresight" Pt. 2, Fever Pitch was seen running from the Sentinels when they invade Genosha.
