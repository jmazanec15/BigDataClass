{{expand section|date=December 2017}}
Abigail Mercy Wright is an extremely unpredictable and dangerous foe, and has given multiple explanations to her origin, including being an alien,<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' #338</ref> an angel,<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' #426</ref> or, much later, a woman who gained her powers through radiation treatments to save her from brain cancer.{{issue|date=January 2013}} She considers herself on a mission of "mercy" to "help" those who are overcome with despair, but don't have the strength to commit suicide, believing that she is doing them a favor. This can include anything from dropping an electric toaster into the bath,<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' #458-459</ref> to guiding the spirit of a comatose person to the afterlife.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' #426</ref> [[Hulk (comics)|The Hulk]] is one of the few people Mercy has been unable to "help," as he refuses to stop fighting, no matter how horrible his existence may be.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' #426</ref>

As part of the ''[[Marvel NOW!]]'' event, Mercy later appears as one of the [[Thunderbolt Ross|Red Hulk]]'s recruits for his new black ops incarnation of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' Vol. 2 #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Mercy has a myriad of different powers. She can fly/levitate, turn intangible and invisible, or teleport to another area with a thought. She is able to project energy spears, which can inflict damage or drain power. She can shift into different shapes, including a large amorphous lump, which can suffocate a victim, or perfectly mimic the form and personality of another person. In a flashback from the ''Hulk: Destruction'' mini-series based upon the game of the same name, she turned into a giant super-strong monster, based upon the "Devil Hulk".<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' #458</ref> When her physical form was destroyed by an exploding tanker, she immediately reformed in another location.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' #458</ref> She can read minds, communicate through telepathy and perform astral projection, and possesses additional extrasensory perceptions enabling her to sense cosmic events of great importance.

==In other media==
===Video games===
* Mercy appears in ''[[The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction]]'', voiced by [[Vanessa Marshall]]. This version appears as the [[bodyguard]] of [[Abomination (comics)|Director Emil Blonsky]] to get rid of gamma-irradiated beings. Mercy has the powers of teleportation, telekinesis, energy manipulation, and levitation. She got her powers from gamma radiation, which was used as treatment that cured her of a brain tumor that would have eventually killed her. During her boss fight, Mercy plans to stop the Hulk from getting the fuel rods, but failed. As Mercy tries to tell the Hulk about her ex-employer's current plans, Blonsky kills Mercy as he blows up the building she was in to try to stop the Hulk.
