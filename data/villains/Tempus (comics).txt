'''Tempus''' is the name of two fictional characters in the [[Marvel Universe]].

The first Tempus is an enormous humanoid who dwells in [[Limbo (Marvel Comics)|Limbo]] and serves [[Immortus]]. An immortal creature created from the stuff of Limbo, he views his undying nature as a curse, and often remarks that he would consider execution a suitable reward for his services to Immortus.

The second is an [[Australian]] teenager, who can create time-freezing bubbles and teleport people through time. She is a new member of the [[Uncanny X-Men#2013–2015: Volume 3|Uncanny X-Men]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Servant of Immortus===
On his master's behalf, the first Tempus has fought many different superheroes, including the [[Fantastic Four]],<ref>''Giant-Size Fantastic Four'' #2</ref> and the [[West Coast Avengers]].<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #62</ref> He was fought and defeated by [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] as part of a plot by Immortus to rob Thor of his ability to travel in time using [[Mjolnir (Marvel Comics)|Mjolnir]].<ref>''Thor'' #281</ref>

The [[Avengers Forever|Destiny War]] was ignited when Immortus sent Tempus to kill an apparently critically ill [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] on the moon. He was defeated by [[Kang the Conqueror]],{{issue|date=December 2011}} but was later rejuvenated in the same series by Immortus and sent to fight [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]].{{issue|date=December 2011}} Tempus' plan to defeat the hero by regressing him backwards through time to the point of non-existence backfired when Hawkeye regained his lost [[Goliath (Marvel Comics)|size changing]] abilities, granting him enough power to defeat Tempus again.{{issue|date=December 2011}}

===Eva Bell===

The second Tempus, Eva Bell, is a goth-punk teenager from [[Gold Coast, Queensland]]. When her powers newly manifest, Cyclops appears and asks her to join his new [[Uncanny X-Men#2013–2015: Volume 3|X-Men]]. She at first doesn't want to and prefers a normal teenage life, but then the Avengers come to recruit her and she decides she will not have a normal life and Cyclops's team will be cooler. She then creates a time bubble that freezes the Avengers, so they can escape.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' (vol. 3) #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Endowed with enormous strength and wielding a club, the first Tempus could trade blows with enemies such as Thor and the alien monster [[Alioth (comics)|Alioth]]. His body was composed of the stuff of Limbo itself, which Immortus could control and use to summon an army of trillions from across time to fight [[Kang the Conqueror]].

Tempus also seemed to have some chronal powers as well, as evidenced by his aforementioned attempt to defeat Hawkeye.

Eva Bell has the ability to create time bubbles that freeze anybody trapped inside. She can also create time bubbles that freeze lasers and bullets. She also learns later that she can teleport others into the future, like when during a training session she teleports Magik 10 seconds into the future. As a young mutant she doesn't know the extent of her powers.
