==Powers and abilities==
Harness wore an armored suit that projected a pair of energy handcuffs she could use to mentally control her son Piecemeal.

The suit enhanced her strength and had a teleportation device, as well as a host of lethal weapons. She also appeared to have cybernetic connections to the suit itself.
