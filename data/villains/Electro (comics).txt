The first comics character of this name was the robot hero Electro, who possessed superhuman strength and could run at 100 miles per hour. He starred in a backup feature star in ''[[Marvel Mystery Comics]]'', the flagship title of Marvel's [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age]] predecessor, [[Timely Comics]]. Created by writer-artist [[Steve Dahlman]], Electro appeared in ''Marvel Mystery'' #4—19 (Feb. 1940—May 1941). His origin story described his invention by Professor Philo Zog, one of a group of twelve known as the Secret Operatives.<ref>[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/jjnevins/electro.html&date=2009-10-26+00:52:27 Guide To Marvel's Golden Age Characters profile for the Timely Comics character], [[Jess Nevins]]</ref><ref>[http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/e/electroga.htm International Catalogue of Superheroes profile for the Timely Comics character]</ref>

In ''[[The Twelve (comic)|The Twelve]]'' by [[J. Michael Straczynski]] and [[Chris Weston]] (published in 2008 and 2012),<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=11312 Mystery Men's Dozen: Brevoort Talks "The Twelve"], July 26, 2007, [[Comic Book Resources]]</ref><ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=124457 12 Days of the Twelve: Elektro] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013191701/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=124457 |date=2007-10-13 }}, August 8, 2007, [[Newsarama]]</ref> Electro is part of a cadre of heroes trapped in a secret bunker during the [[Battle of Berlin]], seemingly for examination by [[Nazi]] scientists. After the fall of the [[Third Reich]], the eleven heroes are left in [[suspended animation]], with no one knowing of their final fate, and Electro is cut off from the telepathic mindwaves of Philo Zog.<ref>The Twelve #1, 2008</ref>

When, sixty years later, the Twelve are recovered and brought back to New York, in a safehouse for rehabilitation to modern times, the still inactive Electro is stored in a garage in the same safehouse, its property contended by Elizabeth Zogolowski, niece of Philo Zog, and the U.S. Government, willing to disassemble Electro for the secrets of his telepathic interface. Miss Zogolowski reveals how the telepathic bond between Philo and his creation was so strong that Philo died shortly after the war from an acute [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] syndrome.<ref>''The Twelve'' '''#???''' 2008</ref>

Miss Zogoloswki is able to obtain temporary custody over Electro, but lacks the wealth necessary to reclaim its possession: the [[Blue Blade]] steps in, offering her all the needed money in exchange for using Electro in his [[cabaret]]-like show.<ref>The Twelve, 2008</ref>

Electro influences the time-traveling adventures in the ''Avengers/Invaders'' crossover. As one of the heroes lost in an alternate-universe World War II, [[Iron Man]] uses his armor's holograms to disguise himself as Electro. This fails to work for the [[Red Skull]] has already slain Electro, along with most of the 'Mystery Men'.<ref>Avengers/Invaders #9-12</ref>

Marvel's next Electro was a [[Communist]] supervillain created during the unsuccessful attempt by Marvel's 1950s predecessor, [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], to revive [[superhero]]es in that decade. This Electro, a Soviet citizen named '''Ivan Kronov''', appeared on the cover and in the six-page story "His Touch is Death" in ''[[Captain America]]'' #78 (Sept. 1954), penciled and inked by [[John Romita Sr.]] and almost certainly if unconfirmably written by [[Stan Lee]]. Many years later, this Electro reappeared in ''What If?'' #9 (June 1978), "What If the Avengers had been Formed During the 1950s?" and, in flashback, in ''Captain America Annual'' #13 (1994).
