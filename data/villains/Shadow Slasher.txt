==Fictional character biography==
Shadow Slasher took a plane from [[Hong Kong]] to the United States to fight [[Shang-Chi]], the Master of Kung Fu. When he finds Shang-Chi, Shadow Slasher tells Shang-Chi to prove that he is the son of [[Fu Manchu]] and they begin to fight. While fighting Shadow Slasher, Shang-Chi was also protecting a blind girl, but still managed to defeat Shadow Slasher, who escapes and says he will return. Later that day, Shadow Slasher attacks Shang-Chi in a park, and is defeated again. Shang-Chi then places the blind girl in the custody of former [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI-6]] agent [[Clive Reston]], and prepares for his final battle with Shadow Slasher. Shadow Slasher meets Shang-Chi in the street and says that every time he fights someone, they always tell him that Shang-Chi is much more skilled than he is and that he would be humbled by the mere presence of the Master of Kung Fu. He is continuously attacking Shang-Chi in an attempt to prove his worth. They begin their final battle and Shang-Chi wins again, and Shadow Slasher escapes again.{{Issue|date=June 2011}}

Shang-Chi then meets up with Reston and the blind girl and they drive to Stormhaven. When they arrive, Reston realizes his trunk lock was broken, and Shadow Slasher jumps out and attacks Shang-chi. Shang-Chi beats him for the last time and leaves him for the police.{{Issue|date=June 2011}}
