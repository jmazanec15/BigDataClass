==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=August 2013}}
Nebula was created by writer [[Roger Stern]] and artist [[John Buscema]], and first appeared in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #257 (July 1985).

==Fictional character biography==
A brutal space pirate and mercenary, Nebula seized control of Sanctuary II, a massive spaceship previously under the command of [[Thanos]]. Thanos was believed to be dead at this point, and Nebula claimed that he had been her grandfather. Nebula's band of mercenaries and pirates consisted of [[Skunge the Laxidazian Troll|Skunge]], [[Kehl of Tauran|Kehl]], [[Gunthar of Rigel|Gunthar]] and [[Levan (comics)|Levan]].

Nebula asked the second [[Monica Rambeau|Captain Marvel]] to join her mercenary band and aid them in conquering the [[Skrull]] Empire. However, [[Firelord (comics)|Firelord]] learned that Nebula had massacred the [[Xandar]]ians. Nebula used her space fleet to attack the Skrull space armada and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''Avengers'' #257, 260</ref>

Nebula then schemed to gain absolute power using Earth scientist Dr. Harker's atomic compressor to release vast amounts of energy that were absorbed by the Infinity Union (Although this attempt nearly triggered the end of the universe when the experiment caused a second Big Bang that came close to annihilating everything before a small group of Avengers – [[Captain America]], [[Iron Man]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], [[Spider-Man]] and [[Sersi]] – were able to escape the destruction and shut down the equipment in time to negate the unmaking of existence). She fought the Avengers, and absorbed energies from the Infinity Union through the implant in her brain. As she fought the Avengers, she lost her powers when Sersi removed the [[brain implant]]. Nebula then escaped.<ref>''Avengers'' #311–312, 314, 316–318</ref>

===The Infinity Gauntlet===
The newly resurrected Thanos was offended by Nebula's claims of kinship. He reclaimed his ship and almost killed her, using the Infinity Gems. He transformed her into a grotesque virtual corpse still barely alive, leaving her as a maimed and seemingly mindless zombie, burned and disfigured by his energy beams.<ref>''Infinity Gauntlet'' #1</ref>

When he later claimed the [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Gauntlet]], Thanos boasted that Nebula was his greatest creation — unable to die, but not truly alive either. However, when Thanos defeated [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]] and took his place, Thanos expanded his consciousness into the universe, leaving his body comatose. Nebula managed to take the Gauntlet from Thanos, using its power to restore herself to health and banish Thanos, seeking to conquer the universe herself. Thanos agreed to help a loose band of heroes defeat Nebula. The group in question consisted of [[Adam Warlock]], [[Doctor Strange]], the [[Silver Surfer]], [[Thunderstrike (Eric Masterson)|Thor]], the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], Firelord, [[Doctor Doom]] and [[Drax the Destroyer]]— the only heroes that Strange had been able to locate in the time available to him. The group confronted her, and, with Thanos exploiting Nebula's inexperience with wielding the Gauntlet, she was tricked into undoing the events of Thanos's godhood and all the death and destruction Thanos wreaked with his power. The Cosmic Pantheon (which Thanos had earlier defeated) immediately appeared, and battled her. With Nebula thus distracted— lacking the knowledge to realize that they were keeping her occupied by attacking her all at once, thus preventing her from thinking of a less direct method of assault— the Surfer and Warlock were able to steal the Gauntlet from her by exploiting Warlock's connection to the Soul Gem, disrupting the unity between the Infinity Gems and forcing Nebula to drop the Gauntlet. Nebula was captured by [[Starfox (comics)|Starfox]] and returned to Titan for trial, while Adam Warlock claimed the Gauntlet.<ref>''Infinity Gauntlet'' #5–6</ref>

Nebula was later confronted by Firelord in the [[Titan (Marvel Comics)|Titanian]] prison. In flashback, the murder of her abusive father was depicted.<ref>''Silver Surfer Annual'' #5</ref> Nebula was later freed from prison by [[Geatar]], and converted into a cyborg by Doctor Mandibus.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 3 #69–73</ref> She attempted to free her pirate crew from the "Anvil" space prison, but was thwarted by the Silver Surfer and [[Jack of Hearts]]. She killed her crew in escaping.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 3 #76–78</ref>

===Annihilation===
Nebula has appeared as one of [[Gamora]]'s followers, 'The Graces'. In this role, she battled [[Ronan the Accuser]] alongside [[Stellaris (comics)|Stellaris]]. Ronan triumphed, severely wounding her.<ref>''Annihilation: Ronan'' #2</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Nebula is an athletic woman and an excellent armed and unarmed combatant. She possesses a gifted intellect and is a brilliant battle strategist.

Nebula uses blasters worn on her wrists that fire concussive blasts of unknown energy or heat blasts that can incinerate a human being almost instantly. She also apparently wears a device that enables her to disguise her appearance, either through illusion-casting or through actual molecular rearrangement of her body and clothing.

Nebula was converted by Doctor Mandibus into a cyborg. She was given an artificial left eye, left arm, and left shoulder. The left upper quarter of her head and part of her right hip are sheathed in metal.

Nebula briefly possessed the Infinity Union, a combination of three devices that together could channel all forms of ambient energy into her which infused her with vast energies. She also briefly possessed the Infinity Gauntlet, which held six "Infinity Gems" of virtually-unlimited power, which gave her seemingly-absolute control of reality while she possessed them. However, her short sightedness meant that she often made crucial errors in judgment when wielding the power, like undoing the events of Thanos's godhood without realizing that this would revert her to her near-death state and free the imprisoned Cosmic Pantheon whom Thanos had recently defeated.

Gamora pretends to betray the Guardians of the Galaxy so that she can get Nebula and her [[Chitauri]] crew into fighting Korath the Pursuer's group.

With help from Star-Lord and Groot, Mandala broke free and uses a special magma attack to send Nebula and Ronan the Accuser flying far away from Mandala.

*[[Karen Gillan]] portrays Nebula in the 2014 live-action film ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/story/20914/marvel_studios_begins_production_on_guardians_of_the_galaxy|title=Marvel Studios Begins Production on Guardians of the Galaxy|publisher=Marvel.com|date=July 20, 2013|accessdate=July 20, 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6IGhiVR0H?url=http://marvel.com/news/story/20914/marvel_studios_begins_production_on_guardians_of_the_galaxy|archivedate=July 21, 2013|deadurl=no|df=}}</ref> She is portrayed as an adopted daughter of [[Thanos]], and she is augmented and converted into a cyborg; at least her arms are completely mechanical, as she is shown making repairs to circuits in her forearm. Despite her familial ties to Thanos, Nebula allies with [[Ronan the Accuser]] when Ronan steals an [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Stone]] to destroy [[Xandar]] and later use against Thanos only to be defeated in combat by [[Gamora]]. When Gamora offers to save her, Nebula rejects Gamora's help and severs her trapped mechanical left hand so that she can steal a ship and escape.
* Gillan reprises the role in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]'', released in May 2017.<ref name="GotGVol2Film">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/15/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-2-zoe-saldana-on-gamora-nebula-and-thanos|title=Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2: Zoe Saldana On Gamora, Nebula And Thanos|last=Vejvoda|first=Jim|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=July 15, 2016|accessdate=July 16, 2016|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6j2G7djVc?url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/15/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-2-zoe-saldana-on-gamora-nebula-and-thanos|archivedate=July 16, 2016|deadurl=no|df=}}</ref> In the film, the Guardians retrieve the arrested Nebula from the Sovereign race, as she was apprehended after trying to steal their batteries. After the Guardians crash-land the ship on a nearby planet due to the Sovereign's ambush (as Rocket was caught stealing the batteries), Rocket and Baby Groot are tasked with looking over Nebula while the rest are taken by Ego to his planet. She assists the Ravagers with a mutiny against Yondu which results in her freedom and Yondu, Rocket, and Groot's capture. Nebula convinces the Ravagers to spare the three due to the many bounties on their heads, of which Nebula wants a 10% cut. She leaves using one of their ships to track down and kill Gamora on Ego, as the torture she received from Thanos and her cybernetic body parts were a result of Gamora constantly defeating her when they were children. She arrives at Ego's planet and tries to kill Gamora, only stopping when she finally bests her sister in combat. Her desire to kill Gamora abated, the pair reach an uneasy alliance, after which they discover caverns filled with the skeletal remains of Ego's many children. She joins the Guardians in combating Ego to defend the universe from his takeover. In the process she rescues Gamora from death and the two reconcile over their shared past trauma. Despite Gamora offering her a chance to stay with the Guardians, Nebula chooses to set out alone in her quest to kill Thanos.

Star-Lord will either tell Gamora that Nebula's family or that calling her could be a mistake. If it is the former, Nebula expresses anger in her call with Gamora of how the Guardians killed their father. In episode 2, Nebula attacks the location where Thanos' body is being held. Regardless on Star-Lord's choice revolving around Rocket Raccoon's trip to Halfworld, Star-Lord and Gamora fight Nebula and managed to subdue her. On the Milano, Nebula is shown to be locked up in Gamora's room. Entering Gamora's room which Nebula has been locked up in, Star-Lord and Gamora tell Nebula that they need her to translate the ancient Kree language which Nebula is reluctant to do. When Nebula tells Gamora that she still remembers Tar-Voll, Gamora draws her sword on her as Nebula orders for Gamora to leave. If Star-Lord has Gamora leave, she does so while stating to Star-Lord that she won't help him if she hears screams. Nebula states that she never cared for them. If Star-Lord agrees with Gamora, he states that Gamora's got the right idea as he pins her against the wall (Star-Lord will also have the option to spit back on her). Drax the Destroyer later tells Star-Lord that there was a device found in Nebula's skull. Star-Lord persuades Nebula into giving him the device where she states that it will tell him everything he'll want to know while stating to Star-Lord that he owes her. When Kree soldiers working for Hala the Accuser attack the ship, Star-Lord will have the option to release Nebula to help fight the Kree soldiers while warning her that the trust exercise will be over if she back-stabs them in battle. In episode 3, Star-Lord experiences Gamora's flashbacks involving Nebula back when she was being trained by Thanos. The first one has Gamora dueling Nebula. Depending on the outcome, Thanos will still favor Nebula as the winner. The second flashback has Nebula being ordered to kill Gamora as a test. After the final flashback, Star-Lord had to decide to tell Nebula to go or told her to stay. If Star-Lord tells Nebula to go at the end, she will join Hala the Accuser's forces. If Star-Lord tells Nebula to stay, she and Gamora finally reconciled.
