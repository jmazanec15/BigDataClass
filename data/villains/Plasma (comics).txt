Leila O'Toole was born in [[Dublin, Ireland]].  As a college student, Leila travels to Egypt to explore the ruins in the Nile Valley.  There, she encounters the Cult of the [[Living Monolith|Living Pharaoh]], was intrigued by the cult and joins. 

She is initially repulsed by the cult's habit of human sacrifice and flees. She is brought back and falls under their spell.

They end up back at the cult's headquarters, via trickery on Leila's part, and in multiple incidents, Havok is forced to fight Leila, who is in disguise. Each blast of his cosmic energy only serves to strengthen her. Even [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] is of no use, as he is quickly knocked out by a blast. In the end, Havok stops her with a simple punch to the face and leaves.{{Issue|date=February 2010}}

Leila decides to recruit cults into one massive army, and starts with the forces of Khonshu, the god which [[Moon Knight]] worships. 

Leila's forces stage a two-pronged attack on New York. The attack at the [[Statue of Liberty]] is foiled, but the one at [[Grand Central Station]] proceeds apace. A well-placed plasma blast traps many innocent victims inside. Mr. Parnell, one of the attendees of a homeless benefit held at the Station, is slain by Plasma.

[[Moon Knight]] and [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Ghost Rider]] attack Plasma. Plasma vaporizes Ghost Rider, who later reforms. In the meantime, Moon Knight takes the fight to a speeding subway train. Plasma meets her end when the train crashes at a high rate of speed.{{Issue|date=February 2010}}
