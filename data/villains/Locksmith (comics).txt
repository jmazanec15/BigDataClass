The '''Locksmith''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
The Locksmith appeared in ''[[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]]'' #50 (June 1983), and was created by [[Ann Nocenti]] and [[Brian Postman]].

==Fictional character biography==
The Locksmith was a lock designer and escape artist who believed that the feats of super-powered beings have overshadowed the achievements of ordinary humans. For this reason, he captured super-powered beings in [[San Francisco]] and imprisoned them within specially designed cells.<ref name="Spider-Woman #50">''Spider-Woman'' #50</ref>

The [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[Tick-Tock]] assisted the Locksmith in capturing various super-heroes and villains and keeping them in the Locksmith's prisons. Among their captives was [[Tigra]], [[Poltergeist (comics)|Poltergeist]], [[Angar the Screamer]], [[Flying Tiger (Marvel Comics)|Flying Tiger]], [[Skein (comics)|Gypsy Moth]], [[Killer Shrike]], [[Needle (comics)|Needle]], [[Tatterdemalion (comics)|Tatterdemalion]], the [[Werewolf by Night|Werewolf]], [[Daddy Longlegs (comics)|Daddy Longlegs]], [[Nekra]], [[Enforcer (comics)|Enforcer]], [[Hangman (Marvel Comics)#Harlan Krueger|Hangman]], and [[Dansen Macabre]].<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #49</ref>

Locksmith and Tick-Tock eventually captured [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]] herself, imprisoning her with their other captives. Tick-Tock used his power to help prevent break-outs, anticipating the prisoners' attempts before they could happen. Spider-Woman had [[Tigra]] insult Poltergeist enough to start a fight, in which they shorted out their specially designed prisons. Spider-Woman then had Gypsy Moth use her powers to swap their costumes. Tick-Tock did not foresee this change.  Once placed in Gypsy Mothâ€™s specific prison, Spider-Woman broke free and released everyone else. After everyone was free, Locksmith collapsed upon having a nervous breakdown. Gypsy Moth restrained Locksmith and Tick-Tock long enough for the authorities to collect them.<ref name="Spider-Woman #50"/>
