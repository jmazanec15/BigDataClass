François LeBlanc was born in France, and later became a professional criminal.

Along with [[Ape-Man#Monk Keefer|Ape-Man]], [[Bird-Man#Henry Hawk|Bird-Man]], and [[Cat-Man (Marvel Comics)#Towshend Horgan|Cat-Man]], François "Frog" LeBlanc was recruited for his leaping ability by a man named the Organizer to form the [[Ani-Men]]. The Organizer was secretly Abner Jonas, a candidate for mayor of New York City, who sent the Ani-Men on missions to undermine the current administration. Daredevil defeated them, and the Ani-Men and Organizer all went to prison.<ref>''Iron Man'' #10-11</ref>

Later, the Ani-Men went to work for [[Count Nefaria]]. Nefaria's scientists submitted the unwitting Ani-Men to processes that gave them superhuman powers and animal-like forms. The Ani-Men invaded the Cheyenne Mountain missile base for Count Nefaria, and fought the [[X-Men]].<ref>''X-Men'' #94-95</ref>

The Ani-Men lost their superhuman powers and reverted to normal. Nefaria sent the four original Ani-Men to kill [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]]. However, the [[Spymaster (comics)#Spymaster I|Spymaster]] detonated a bomb,which was intended to kill Stark, and the resulting explosion killed the Ani-Men instead.<ref>''Iron Man'' #115-116</ref>

During the ''[[Secret Wars]]'' storyline, a second Frog-Man, alongside a third Ape-Man and a third Cat-Man, went on a crime spree when the heroes were on Battleworld. They somehow got the equipment of the original Ani-Men and used it to rob a vault wagon only to be opposed by the NYPD.<ref>Code of Honor #3</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Originally, LeBlanc had no superhuman powers. He was an athletic man with an Olympic-level leaping ability. He was an excellent hand-to-hand combatant, and an expert in ''[[savate]]'' (French kickboxing). LeBlanc was later subjected to an unknown mutagenic process administered by [[Count Nefaria]]'s scientists which temporarily gave him frog-like legs that gave him superhuman leaping, as well as superhuman strength, stamina and agility.
