'''Vincente Cimetta''' is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] villain from the ''[[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]]'' title belonging to [[Marvel Comics]]. He was created by writer [[Scott Lobdell]] and first appeared in the [[Marvel Universe|Main Marvel Universe]] in ''Generation X'' #12, although an [[#other versions|alternate universe]] version had appeared the year before.

== Fictional character biography ==
First appearing alongside the [[energy vampire|vampiric]] mutant [[Emplate]], Vincente belonged to a group of evil mutants which—only in advertising—was known as the [[Hellions (comics)#Temporary group of new Hellions|Hellions]]. Vincente battled Generation X alongside [[Gayle Edgerton]], [[Murmur (Marvel Comics)#Murmur (Hellions)|Murmur]], D.O.A., and [[Bulwark (comics)|Bulwark]].{{issue|date=December 2012}}

On the team's first strike against the young mutants, Vincente hid himself inside of a pot of soup at a restaurant. When [[M (comics)|M]] opened the lid to smell it, he entered her [[lung]]s and tried to [[asphyxia|suffocate]] her. He succeeded in knocking most of the team [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]], but not before M let out a [[telepathy|telepathic]] cry for help. Her cry was heard by [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] of the [[X-Men]], who came to her rescue.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Oddly enough, the mutant from the future had a connection to Emplate, as a group of [[parasitism|parasitic]] mutants calling themselves ''the Emplates'' plagued Bishop's future timeline. This gave him the sign he needed to rescue the teens in danger. Vincente tried to attack Bishop in the same manner he did Generation X, but the mutant's natural ability of absorption began to digest Vincente in his mist form. He was able to escape with his life, and left with his teammates after they were beaten.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Vincente made one more appearance with Emplate's gang (this time sporting new members) when the villain tried once again to reclaim [[Penance (X-Men)|Penance]] as his possession. Vincente had learned the ability to make his vapor form poisonous, but that didn't stop him from being beaten yet again. After his ignominious defeat, he never appeared in the [[Earth-616|Main Marvel Universe]] again. His status after the recent [[Decimation (comics)|depowering of most of the Earth's mutant population]] has yet to be revealed.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

== Other versions ==
=== Age of Apocalypse ===
In the [[Age of Apocalypse]], Emplate never formed his Hellions, so Vincente, in this universe green rather than the purple of the main Marvel Universe, was free to join [[Age of Apocalypse#Generation Next|Generation Next]] (the AoA version of Generation X led by [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] and [[Kitty Pryde|Shadowcat]]), instead of fighting them.

After the team was given the mission of breaking in to '''the Core'''—a [[nuclear power|nuclear power plant]] and [[internment|internment camp]] for humans—Vincente and [[Husk (comics)|Husk]] decided to try and sneak in the back door by posing as the foreman '''Quietus'''. They snuck in to Quietus' office as a sexually interested girl with a [[wiktionary:flask|flask]] of [[wine]] (Vincente in liquid form). Once Quietus drank the wine, Vincente forced his way out of the man's body, effectively killing him. Because Husk didn't have enough mass to become Quietus by herself, she required Vincente to fill out the remainder of the body with his vaporous form.  On their way to find [[Magik (comics)|Illyana Rasputin]], they unfortunately ran into [[Sugar Man]]. Although they attempted to shoot the maniac, he stabbed the pair with his razor-sharp tongue, almost killing Husk and delivering a fatal blow to Vincente, even though he was in his gaseous form at the time. He might have survived if the group of youngsters had not become trapped in the Core and overwhelmed by their adversaries.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

== Powers and abilities ==
Vincente is able to shift his state of matter from solid to liquid to gaseous. In his liquid or gaseous state he is capable of mixing his molecules with the surrounding substances (e.g., dirt, soup, etc.) and thereby temporarily take on the properties of what he is mixed with. As he honed his abilities, he learned how to change the composition of his gaseous state so that it would be toxic if inhaled.
