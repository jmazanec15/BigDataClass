'''Shock''' a.k.a. ''Ariel Tremmore'' is a [[fictional character]], and a [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. A psychopathic killer, she fought with [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] in his side of New York City.

As Shock, Ariel possesses the power to induce fear and hallucinations in other people by releasing pheromones through her skin.

==Publication history==

'''Shock''' a.k.a. Ariel Tremmore was introduced in Daredevil #314 and appeared in Daredevil #314-315.

==Fictional character biography==
Ariel is the daughter of ''Alan Fagan'' (the fourth [[Mr. Fear]]), and hence the grand niece of Alan's uncle, ''Larry Cranston'' (the third [[Mr. Fear]]) who had fought with [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]. Ariel is the illegitimate child of Alan Fagan and Cora Tremmore, after they had an affair. Alan refused to take any responsibility for Ariel, and abandoned both Cora and Ariel.<ref name=d314>''Daredevil'' #314</ref>

Cora grew angry at Alan, and this anger rubbed off on Ariel as she grew up. After Cora died in a horrific workplace accident, Ariel dedicated herself to her mother's goal of being better than her father and sought vengeance on him for his absence in their lives and for the embarrassment of having the notorious ''Mr. Fear'' as a father.

Ariel found that she needed a source of income to live in the city, and she turned to a variety of ways of making money including [[theft]] and [[prostitution]].<ref name=d314/>

Eventually Ariel paid a group of prison inmates to attack her imprisoned father and to bring her a piece of skin from his face. After receiving the sample, Arial took it to a chemist to be examined; Ariel theorised that her father's skin sample would be laced with some of his ''fear-gas'' that he had used as Mr. Fear. This was of interest to Ariel as she was determined to produce a new and improved fear chemical for use against her father. Once the chemical had been synthesised, Ariel injected it into her own body and was transformed into a fearsome looking creature. She decided to call herself as this creature ''Shock'', the ''Mistress of Fear''.<ref name=d315>''Daredevil'' #315</ref>

Using her newfound powers, she terrorised the population of [[New York City]] and attracted Daredevil's attention, who used his super-senses to trace the scent of the chemical back to Ariel. Transforming into Shock, she used her abilities to enrage Daredevil, and she knocked him off the top of the building as they fought. They both landed safely, and Shock escaped by using her powers to cause panic in the streets.<ref name=d315/>

Shock then visited her father in hospital. He was dying, but Shock tormented him with her powers until his vital signs began to strengthen. At the same time, Daredevil tracked her down again ready to bring her in. But this time she caused him to hallucinate that he was being attacked by Elektra.<ref name=d315/>

In turn, Daredevil managed to keep his head clear enough from illusions to force Shock to take another dose of her chemical. This trasformed her back into her human form, and made it easy for her to be arrested. While she was being sent to jail, Ariel's hands turned back to their taloned form and she readied herself to break free.<ref name=d315/>

==Powers and abilities==
By consuming the chemical synthesized by her father's skin, Ariel transformed into a monstrous, nightmarish creature with razor sharp teeth and talons, scaly-skin with pointed ears and long red hair. In this form, Ariel was known as Shock.

As Shock she can generate terror, rage, hallucinations and hatred in other people through pheromones released through her skin.

She did not appear to be able to generate her emotion manipulating pheromones in her human form. However, the ending of her last appearance suggests that she may be able to transform to and from her monstrous form at will, rather than relying on chemicals.<ref>''Daredevil'' #314-315</ref>
