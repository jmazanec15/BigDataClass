'''Thomas Foster''' is a [[Fictional character|fictional]] [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is the fifth to hold the mantle of '''[[Goliath (Marvel Comics)|Goliath]]''' and is also the nephew of [[Bill Foster (comics)|Bill Foster]].

==Publication history==
'''Tom Foster''' made his first appearance in ''Black Panther'' Vol. 3 #23 and was created by [[Reginald Hudlin]], [[Greg Pak]] and [[Koi Turnbull]]. He subsequently succeeded in gaining superpowers and becoming '''Goliath''' in ''World War Hulk: Aftersmash'' #1, before appearing to join Damage Control in the same issue.

===Greg Pak on Tom Foster's creation===
On the creation of Foster, Pak stated: 

{{cquote|Way back when I was starting my first outline of "World War Hulk," I had this crazy notion that Bill Foster, the original Black Goliath, would end up siding with our Green Goliath. Shortly thereafter, I learned that Bill was picking up a toe-tag in the pages of "Civil War." But in the back of my head, something kept ticking, and eventually I pitched the idea of introducing a new character named Tom Foster as one of the supporting players in the "Incredible Hulk" tie-in issues to "World War Hulk."

Assistant Editor Nate Cosby informed me that Reginald Hudlin had had a similar brainstorm for "Black Panther." So the offices coordinated a bit and a mysterious nephew of Bill Foster appeared in "Black Panther," then showed up later in "Incredible Hulk" #107 as one of the humans taking the Hulk's side during World War Hulk.

Tom played a major role in "World War Hulk" #4 as one of the humans who testified about the supposed crimes of Illuminati. My nefarious plan was always to have him take his uncle's mantle. And while I was brainstorming the "Aftersmash" one-shot with Mark and Executive Editor [[Tom Brevoort]], I had this image of a giant splash page of Tom as the new Goliath helping rebuild Manhattan. I said, "I know the last page of the book," and things went from there. Now we're bouncing the character over to Dwayne for a star turn in "Damage Control" -- I can't wait to see what happens next!"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=12542 |title=CBR News: THE COMMENTARY TRACK: "Aftersmash" #1 with Greg Pak |publisher=Comic Book Resources |date=2007-12-07 |accessdate=2011-01-06}}</ref>}}

==Fictional character biography==
[[Image:TomFosterDamage.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Goliath working for '''Damage Control''', Artist Rafa Sandoval.]]
'''Tom Foster''' was introduced in ''Black Panther'' #23, when he and his family were visited by [[Black Panther (comics)|King T'Challa]] and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Queen Ororo]] of [[Wakanda (Marvel)|Wakanda]], following the murder of his uncle [[Bill Foster (comics)|Bill Foster]] during the superhero [[Civil War (comics)|civil war]]. Angry at the pro-registration forces for his uncle's death, Tom swore to continue his legacy by replicating the [[Pym Particles]] which give Bill his powers. To this end, T'Challa swore to assist him in any way he could, once Tom finished his studies at [[M.I.T]].<ref>''[[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]'' #23</ref>

Tom next appeared during the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]'s [[World War Hulk|invasion of Manhattan]]. He was amongst a group of Hulk-supporters who defied government orders to evacuate the island, and made their way to [[Madison Square Gardens|the Madison arena]] to watch the Warbound extract their brand of justice on the city's superheroes. Before the gladiatorial matches began, he delivered a speech in which he criticised the way [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] and [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] were, in his view, responsible for killing his uncle, declaring himself 'ready for the Hulk's justice'- in this case, death by combat.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

After the Hulk and Warbound were defeated and removed from Manhattan, Tom used the chaos to sneak into the abandoned labs of the [[Avengers Mansion]], in which he located a vial of liquefied [[Pym Particles]]. Upon gaining powers and becoming Goliath, he sought out and assaulted Iron Man in retaliation for his uncle's death, but was interrupted by an internal struggle between the captured Warbound. Following this conflict, Tom turned away from confronting Tony Stark. Tom Foster began assisting [[Damage Control (comics)|Damage Control]] with their repairs of the city which involved stopping a runaway [[Chrysler Building]] that was animated by one of Hulk's destroyed machines.<ref>''[[World War Hulk|World War Hulk: Aftersmash]]'' #1</ref>

Goliath later joins the [[Revengers]], a team of anti-heroes assembled by [[Wonder Man]] (who had a leaking ionic energy problem at the time which affected his judgement) in his plot to defeat the Avengers.<ref>''New Avengers Annual'' Vol. 2 #1</ref> He and the rest of the Revengers were defeated by all three Avengers teams and remanded to the [[The Raft (comics)|Raft]]. During Tom Foster's interrogation, he stated that he still blames Iron Man for his part in his uncle's death.<ref>''New Avengers Annual'' Vol. 2 #2</ref>

For his crimes with the Revengers, Tom is sent to the super-prison known as the Cellar as seen during the ''[[Civil War II]]'' storyline. A few years later, the [[Mad Thinker]] tries to recruit Tom during a massive prison break. Tom refused the offer. Once his power dampeners are removed, Tom uses his abilities to defeat the villains and save the lives of several guards. For his heroic actions, Tom is released from the Cellar on [[parole]].<ref>''Civil War II: Choosing Sides #2</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Using the Pym particles, Tom Foster can manipulate the size and shape of his body at will, enlarging himself to giant size. In his large form, his strength and durability increase to superhuman levels.
