'''Blue Diamond''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], debuting under the company's 1940s forerunner, [[Timely Comics]].

An unrelated [[supervillain]] called the Blue Diamond appears as an [[antagonist]] in Timely's ''[[Human Torch (android)|The Human Torch]]'' #11 (Spring 1943).

==Publication history==
The Blue Diamond first appeared in ''[[Daring Mystery Comics]]'' #7 (April 1941), published by Marvel's 1940s predecessor, [[Timely Comics]], during the period fans and historians call the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]]. During that time, he appeared only in that issue and its subsequent, final issue, #8 (January 1942). He was drawn by Jack Kirby written by Joe Simon.

The majority of the character's [[World War II]] adventures appear in a flashback story in ''Marvel Premiere'' #29-30 (April, June 1976), Marvel's [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] series ''[[Invaders (comics)|The Invaders]]''  #6 (May 1976), #35-38 (December 1978-March 1979), and #41 (September 1979), and in later series in ''[[New Invaders]]'' #2 (November 2004) #9 (June 2005), and ''[[Citizen V|Citizen V and V Battalion: The Everlasting]]'' #1 (March 2002), along with an appearance with the World War II superhero team the [[Liberty Legion]] in ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'' #20 (Oct. 1976) and ''Marvel Two-In-One Annual'' #1 (1976). He also appears in flashbacks as a member of the [[Crazy Sues]] in ''All-Winners Squad: Band of Heroes'' (2011).

The Blue Diamond made an appearance in modern-day continuity, in ''Marvel Two-In-One'' #79 (Sept. 1981).

==Fictional character biography==
Elton T. Morrow is an archaeologist who finds a mysterious blue diamond on an expedition to [[Antarctica]]. The diamond is a piece of the Lifestone Tree, which powers the alien Chosen Eight of Fate. A German sub attacks Morrow's ship on the way home and Morrow is the only survivor. An explosion shattered the diamond during the battle, forcing innumerable tiny diamond particles into Morrow's body. After he is rescued by a British ship, he finds that the shards of the diamond gave him diamond-hard skin, giving him superhuman strength and nigh-invulnerability. Dubbing himself the Blue Diamond, he battles [[Nazi]] spies during [[World War II]] as part of the [[Crazy Sues (comics)|Crazy Sues]].<ref>''All-Winners Squad: Band of Heroes'' #1</ref>

After spending years in retirement, the Blue Diamond returns to assist the [[Fantastic Four]]'s [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] against [[Star-Dancer|Shanga]], a crystal based alien. Shanga falls in love with Blue Diamond, and turns him into a living humanoid diamond creature as her consort.<ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' #79</ref> Morrow returns to Earth to join the new [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]].<ref>''Avengers/Invaders'' #12</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The strange blue diamond particles embedded in Blue Diamond's body have made his skin as strong as a diamond, giving him superhuman strength and nigh-invulnerability. After his body was altered by Shanga, Blue Diamond gains the power of flight and the ability to survive in the vacuum of space. The alterations to his body also reversed the effects of aging.
