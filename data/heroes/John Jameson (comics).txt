'''John Jonah Jameson III''' (also known by the aliases '''Colonel Jupiter''', '''Man-Wolf''', and '''Stargod''') is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is the son of [[J. Jonah Jameson]] and the grandson of J. Jonah Jameson, Sr.

==Publication history==
John Jameson debuted in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #1 (March 1963), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]].<ref name="Manning18">{{cite book|last = Manning|first = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|page = 18|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= [''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #1] introduced readers to ''The Daily Bugle'' publisher and anti-Spider-Man activist J. Jonah Jameson, as Spidey saved his astronaut son, John, from a space mission gone awry.}}</ref> This first story introduces the character as a prominent [[astronaut]].

During his lengthy stint on ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' during the 1970s, writer [[Gerry Conway]] had Jameson turned into a [[werewolf]], with the new alias "Man-Wolf". Conway explained: {{quote|I'd wanted to do something with [John Jameson] for a long time. I felt like he was a character who'd gotten lost over the years. Also, at this point, it's 1973, John Jameson is an astronaut, and [[Apollo 11|we've been to the moon]], so I asked myself, "What would we do with that in Spider-Man's world?" And that was how it played out. It also added another layer of tension to Spider-Man's relationship with J. Jonah Jameson. As a writer, you always want to find a way to increase the pressure on the main character, to increase the involvement of other characters with that character. Consequently, anything that could make Jonah's hatred of Spider-Man more intense and at the same time more understandable was a useful device dramatically.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Williams|first= Scott E.|date= October 2010|title= Gerry Conway: Everything but the Gwen Stacy Sink|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 44| page= 10|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>}} As the Man-Wolf, Jameson was the lead feature in ''[[Creatures on the Loose]]'' #30 (July 1974) to #37 (September 1975).<ref>Manning "1970s" in Gilbert (2012), p. 75: "Man-Wolf was awarded his own regular spotlight in the ongoing title ''Creatures on the Loose''...Man-Wolf's adventures became the focus of this title until its conclusion with issue #37."</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
John Jonah Jameson III was born in [[New York City]]. He is the son of [[J. Jonah Jameson]], the irascible, gruff publisher of the ''[[Daily Bugle]]''. Jonah is immensely proud of his son, whom he sees as a true hero. Initially an astronaut, he was first seen being saved by [[Spider-Man]] when his craft malfunctioned on re-entry,<ref name="Manning18" /> something that did nothing to endear the wall-crawler to his father, who resents Spider-Man's form of heroism.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #1 (March 1963)</ref>

On a later mission, Jameson was infected with spores that gave him super-strength, but strained his body and mind. He was forced to wear a strength-restraining "Jupiter suit" and battled Spider-Man at his father's urging before recovering and calling himself '''Colonel Jupiter'''. His father convinced him to go after Spider-Man, who had been seen apparently robbing a bank. The web-slinger outsmarted him, and Jonah soon learned that Spider-Man was saving the bank from a bomb. However, John didn't care about the misunderstanding; he was really out for revenge. Spider-Man managed to neutralize the spores with electricity, returning Jameson to normal.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #41-42</ref><ref>Manning "1960s" in Gilbert (2012), p. 37: "Spider-Man tangled with a powered-up John Jameson, driven half-mad by contact with spores encountered on a space walk."</ref>

While he was on the moon, Jameson found the mystical Godstone, an other-dimensional [[ruby]]. The jewel grafted itself to his throat and extended tendrils through his body. Moonlight activated the gem, which transformed him into the [[Werewolf|lycanthropic]] '''Man-Wolf''',<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Gerry Conway|Conway, Gerry]]|penciller= [[Gil Kane|Kane, Gil]]|inker= [[John Romita, Sr.|Romita, Sr., John]]; [[Tony Mortellaro|Mortellaro, Tony]]|story= The Mark of the Man-Wolf|title= The Amazing Spider-Man|issue= 124|date= September 1973}}</ref> and he fought Spider-Man in this bestial form.<ref>Manning "1970s" in Gilbert (2012), p. 70: "The Man-Wolf, a major new threat to Spider-Man and his supporting cast, was introduced in a two-part tale that saw the werewolf terrorize J.

Man-Wolf was again thwarted by Spider-Man.<ref name="GSSH">{{cite comic| writer= Conway, Gerry|penciller= Kane, Gil|inker= [[Mike Esposito (comics)|Esposito, Mike]]|story= Chapter 1: Man-Wolf at Midnight!/Chapter 2: Duel of the Demon Duo!/Chapter 3: When Strikes the Vampire!|title= Giant-Size Super-Heroes|issue= 1|date= June 1974}}</ref>

Later, he was transported to the [[List of Marvel Comics dimensions|dimension]] known as "Other Realm", from which the ruby originated and the source of the radiation that transforms John into the Man-Wolf. It was revealed that the ruby was created by the dying Stargod to pass on his powers. While on Earth Jameson could only partially transform, resulting in his berserk behavior. While in the Other Realm he could fully transform, resulting in retention of his human consciousness while in lupine form. He took up the mantle of '''Stargod''', and acted as champion of the Other Realm, and gained new powers such as [[telepathy]] and energy manipulation. He fought his foes with a sword, dagger, and longbow in this incarnation.<ref>''[[Creatures on the Loose]]'' #30-37; ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #45-46, ''[[The Savage She-Hulk]]'' 13-14.</ref> Afterward, he opted to return to Earth, resulting in him losing the ability to fully transform, and the loss of all memories of being the Stargod. He later allowed himself to be subjected to a procedure that removed the ruby, restoring normalcy for some time.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[David Anthony Kraft|Kraft, David Anthony]]|penciller= [[James Sherman (comics)|Sherman, James]]; [[Alan Weiss (comics)|Weiss, Alan]]|inker= [[Steve Mitchell (comics)|Mitchell, Steve]]|story= Dark Side of the Moon|title= [[The Spectacular Spider-Man]] Annual|issue= 3|date= 1981}}</ref><ref>Manning "1980s" in Gilbert (2012), p. 121: "With the help of Dr. Curt Connors and Spider-Man, John was cured of his condition, seemingly forever."</ref>

Jameson became the pilot of [[Captain America]]'s personal [[Quinjet]] for a period, using the call-sign "Skywolf".{{issue|date=June 2012}} During this time, he was temporarily transformed into Man-Wolf by [[Dredmund the Druid|Dredmond Druid]], who wanted the power of the Stargod.{{issue|date=June 2012}} Jameson left Captain America's employ due to his attraction to Captain America's then girlfriend, [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Diamondback]].{{issue|date=June 2012}}

Jameson remains friends with Spider-Man and often tries to convince his father to "let up on him." He spent some time as [[Ravencroft]] Head of Security and briefly dated its director Dr. Ashley Kafka. Both John and Ashley were fired by a director angry about the escape of the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] and his subsequent wounding by [[Kraven the Hunter]] II. Via hypnotherapy, Kafka helped discover that [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]] had caused him to attack his hospitalized father. This therapy also briefly unleashed John's Man-Wolf aspect before Ashley was able to help John suppress his changes once more.

During the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' storyline, John helped Captain America while the latter was in hiding. He was assisting She-Hulk in locating and signing up unregistered superheroes. John has also been registered as the Man-Wolf under the [[Registration acts (comics)|Superhuman Registration Act]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}} During this time, the villain [[Stegron]] temporarily transformed him into the Man-Wolf again, as a side-effect of his latest mad scheme, to devolve the entire population of New York City. He attacked [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]] and [[Aunt May]] in the [[Avengers Tower]], but was subdued by [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]]'s [[Guardsman (comics)|Guardsmen]] before he could harm them.<ref>''Sensational Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #25</ref> [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] subsequently cured him of this form.<ref>''Sensational Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #27</ref>

John had been dating [[She-Hulk]] (Jennifer Walters) and the two had been living together for some time along with She-Hulk's coworker, Augustus Pugliese.<ref>''She-Hulk'' #8 (2005)</ref> Eventually they [[elope]]d in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]].<ref>''She-Hulk'' #9 (2005)</ref> However, John was forced into becoming the Man-Wolf once more after being injected by a mysterious substance. After a brief rampage, John stopped fighting his situation and became the Stargod again.{{Issue|date=August 2009}} He now retains his intelligence while in Man-Wolf form, has the Stargod's powers, and apparently can switch between human and lupine forms. His current superhuman status can be defined in his own words as "''I am a god''" and is supported by a battle with a clone of the Mad Titan [[Thanos]] in which he held his own.{{Issue|date=August 2009}} However, John does not want to be the Stargod because he feels that having powers makes him arrogant and savage. She-Hulk and Stargod separated after she discovered that her feelings for John were influenced prior to their marriage by her former [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] teammate, [[Starfox (comics)|Starfox]],{{Issue|date=August 2009}} and when she learned that John had hoped to convince her to give up her powers permanently.{{Issue|date=August 2009}} Dejected, Stargod sought adventure in outer space,{{Issue|date=August 2009}} before finally returning to Earth.{{Issue|date=August 2009}} He resumed his human form and tried to reconcile with Jennifer, but when she rejected him again, John realized their relationship was truly over and he signed the legal papers [[annulment|annulling]] their marriage.{{Issue|date=August 2009}}

When it came to John Jameson's next mission into space, [[Alistair Smythe]], [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]], and a new villain named [[Fly-Girl]] attack the launch site with an army of cyborg minions (each one wanting revenge on J. Jonah Jameson) where they sabotaged the launch and hold John Jameson for ransom.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #652</ref> John was saved.{{issue|date=April 2013}}

Soon after, John Jameson was attacked on the Apogee 1 Space Station by co-workers mind-controlled by [[Doctor Octopus]], who wanted to take control of the station. With the help of Spider-Man and the [[Human Torch]], he was able to save the day and the station safely crashed into the ocean, its employees alive and well.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #680-681</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Jameson is a skilled pilot and astronaut and is experienced in hand-to-hand combat and a variety of weapons.

While Jameson was doing search and rescue missions in the Middle East, the American military discovered that another Godstone had grown within his body, the original having altered his physiology to the point that he now spawns replacement gems.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Gerry Conway|penciller = Mike Perkins|inker = Mike Perkins|colorist = Andy Troy|letterer = VC's Joe Sabino|editor = Nick Lowe|story = The One That Got Away, Part Three|title = Carnage|volume = 2|issue = #3|date = 30 December 2015|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> When the new Godstone is ripped out and crushed by Carnage, another immediately appears and heals Jameson.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Gerry Conway|penciller = Mike Perkins|inker = Mike Perkins|colorist = Andy Troy|letterer = VC's Joe Sabino|editor = Nick Lowe|story = The One That Got Away, Part Five|title = Carnage|volume = 2|issue = #5|date = 17 January 2016|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

===As the Man-Wolf===
Jameson possessed superhuman strength, agility, speed and durability, an accelerated healing factor and heightened senses. He also has large razor sharp teeth and claws to use as weapons once transformed. The Man-Wolf's strength and degree of intelligence varied according to the phases of the moon. Jameson did not retain his personality or intelligence while in Man-Wolf form. He was not a traditional werewolf and was invulnerable to silver.

===As Stargod=== 
While in the Other Realm, Jameson possessed both his human intellect and the Man-Wolf's body, as well as vast superhuman strength, a high degree of durability, and cosmic and telepathic powers, the full extent of which is yet unrevealed. He wears scale mail armor and uses a broadsword, dagger, short bow, and arrows.

===What If?===
In "[[What If (comics)|What If]] the Radioactive Spider Had Bitten Someone Else?", John Jameson is one of three candidates - along with [[Betty Leeds|Betty Brant]] and [[Flash Thompson]] - who is bitten by the radioactive spider which gave [[Spider-Man]] his powers. Equipped with a rocket pack, and upon his father's relentless prompting for the sake of his paper's publicity, John begins to fight crime as "Spider Jameson". However, when he attempts to save an astronaut from his crashing capsule (the same situation from which he was saved by Spider-Man in [[Earth-616|mainstream continuity]]), his rocket pack runs out of fuel, but Jameson heroically sacrifices his life by using his own body to cushion the capsule's impact. The death of his son makes Jonah Jameson re-think his relentless attitudes, and he subsequently dedicates the ''Daily Bugle'' to the promotion of superheroes, not their persecution.<ref>''What If?'' Vol. 1 #7</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* John Jameson appeared in "The Alien Costume" saga of ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Michael Horton (actor)|Michael Horton]]. In his first appearance, he unwittingly brings the [[Symbiote (comics)|Symbiote]] to Earth. John Jameson ended up in the hospital following the crash-landing. When J. Jonah Jameson visits John in the hospital, John Jameson mentions about Spider-Man fighting "[[Rhino (comics)|a guy in a rhino suit]]" which proved that Rhino was the one who robbed the shuttle. Shocker later abducted John Jameson from the hospital which draws Spider-Man and J. Jonah Jameson to an abandoned church. While Spider-Man fought Shocker, J. Jonah Jameson got his son away from the church. While still in a wheelchair following his abduction, John Jameson visited the Daily Bugle where he was welcomed by its staff.

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:ManWolfSpiderManUnlimited.jpg|thumb|right|Man-Wolf battling Spider-Man in ''Spider-Man Unlimited''.]] -->
* The character appeared in ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited]]'', with John Jameson voiced by [[John Payne (voice actor)|John Payne]] while Man-Wolf's vocal effects are provided by [[Scott McNeil]]. While traveling into space, John Jameson crashed on [[Counter-Earth (comics)|Counter-Earth]] thanks to [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] and [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]]. After Spider-Man went there to save him and return him back to Earth, John and Spider-Man joined the human rebels to fight the [[High Evolutionary]] and his Beastials and restore peace to Counter-Earth. Man-Wolf's first animated appearance occurs in the episode "Ill Met By Moonlight" when the High Evolutionary had experimented on John Jameson and he becomes Man-Wolf every time he gets angry.
* John Jameson appears in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0804/25/index.htm |title=Comics Continuum by Rob Allstetter: Friday, April 25, 2008 |publisher=Comicscontinuum.com |date=2008-04-25 |accessdate=2011-01-12}}</ref> voiced by [[Daran Norris]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} When his father [[J. Jonah Jameson]] planned on writing an article on how John saved New York City by finding the [[Green Goblin]]'s planted bomb, John warned him it would lead to an investigation that would pull him from a coming space mission so Jameson reluctantly attributed John's actions to Spider-Man. Later on, his spaceship malfunctions after being hit by an asteroid and nearly crashes (similar to ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #1) but John is able to safely land his ship, which contains the alien symbiote. Jonah's anger that other newspapers which had [[Spider-Man]]'s battle with Green Goblin on the front page sold more than the Daily Bugle, with John's survival as the front-page story, caused Jonah to intensify his hatred for Spider-Man and discredit him even more. In the episode "Growing Pains", John is revealed to have been exposed to alien spores, due to contact with the symbiote, that have been making him bigger, heavier and stronger, causing [[Lizard (comics)|Dr. Curt Connors]] to design a special suit for him. At the time when [[Eddie Brock|Venom]] was framing Spider-Man, Jonah had his son become the superhero 'Colonel Jupiter'. Venom attacked him, framing Spider-Man and causing the spores' effects on him to increase, eventually leading Jameson to fight Spider-Man. After a brutal fight, Spider-Man discovered that electricity could destroy the spores. Upon being exposed to 2,000,000 volts of electricity, John returned to being physically normal. He later ended up in Ravencroft still craving the power from the spores.
* John Jameson/Man-Wolf appears in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' episode "The Man-Wolf", voiced by [[Nolan North]]. Spider-Man, his team (consisting of [[Luke Cage|Power Man]], [[White Tiger (Ava Ayala)|White Tiger]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] and [[Nova (Sam Alexander)|Nova]]), and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] answer a distress signal coming from J. Jonah Jameson to look for his son on the moon that was supervising the construction of a ''Daily Bugle'' communications station. Onsite however, the construction crew found the remains of an advanced civilization harboring a number of strange jewels. One of these jewels has embedded itself in John's chest and triggered his transformation into the feral Man-Wolf (with the trappings and the sword used by Stargod). Spider-Man manages to shatter the jewel, but the sudden reversion causes John to retain some wolfish features. John Jameson is kept in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody for treatment while J. Jonah Jameson blames Spider-Man and S.H.I.E.L.D. for his son's condition. Nick Fury told J. Jonah Jameson that his son was saved because of Spider-Man and to put that in his moustache and "chew on it."
* John Jameson/Man-Wolf appears in ''[[Spider-Man (2017 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'', voiced by [[Josh Keaton]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=Halloween Moon|series=Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=1|number=11|airdate=October 7, 2017}}</ref> In the episode "Osborn Academy," John Jameson is among the people that audition for a spot in Osborn Academy where he shows his space program knowledge. In the episode "Halloween Moon," John Jameson and Harry Osborn worked on an experiment that involved a lunar crystal that fed off gamma radiation which turned John Jameson into Man-Wolf whose scratch turned those who were struck by Man-Wolf's claws into werewolves. It took Spider-Man, Hulk, Gwen Stacy, and Harry Osborn to undo the effects of the Man-Wolf transformations and cure the infected. While Norman Osborn was displeased that he got Harry involved upon being given the lunar crystal, John Jameson stated the Man-Wolf form had a different personality as Norman Osborn plans to find a way to fix the lunar crystal's effects.

===Film===
* John Jameson appeared in ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'', portrayed by [[Daniel Gillies]]. He is again an astronaut, noted for apparently being the first man to play football on the moon. In the film, he rather quickly develops a relationship with [[Mary Jane Watson]] when a strain is caused on her friendship with Peter Parker, and she immediately accepts his marriage proposal. However, Mary Jane realizes that she does not truly love John and leaves him at the altar to go back to Peter.
