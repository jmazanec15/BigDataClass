'''Wild Thing''' ('''Rina Logan''') is a fictional character from Marvel Comics, who exists in the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] universe, an alternate future to the [[Marvel Universe]]. She is the daughter of the [[X-Men]]'s [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and the rogue mercenary [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]].  She first appeared in ''[[J2 (comics)|J2]]'' #5 and was created by [[Tom DeFalco]] and [[Ron Lim]].

An unrelated character named [[Wild Thing (Nikki Doyle)|Wild Thing]], who fought crime in a future [[virtual reality]] world, had her own brief series under the [[Marvel UK]] imprint in 1993.<ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix2/wildthingnikkidoyle.htm Wild Thing (Nikki Doyle)] at the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe</ref>

==Publication history==
Wild Thing first appeared in Marvel Comics' "[[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]]" line of [[Spin-off (media)|spin-offs]] (specifically, in ''[[J2 (comics)|J2]]'' #5). She soon gained her own (short-lived) series. The run enjoyed some acclaim, but due to low sales, the title was cancelled after issue #5. Rina later appeared in the ''Last Hero Standing'' miniseries.

==Fictional character biography==
Rina was the new girl at a high school, where some of the more popular girls tried to make her life miserable, describing her as the daughter of an immigrant and an unemployed biker. However, when her father Logan (Wolverine) picked her up from school on his bike, opinions changed about her, especially when they learned that her mother Elektra was a wealthy [[martial arts]] expert. As Wild Thing, Rina saved a classmate from a high-speed kidnapper, defeated a computerized assassin, stopped a demonic invader and fought one of her teachers when he was turned into a [[Prime Sentinel]].

For a short period of time, Wild Thing was a member of a superhero team composed of herself, [[Magneta]], and [[Daze (comics)|Daze]], but Wild Thing quit when Magneta became villainous. When [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] kidnapped several of Earth's heroes (including her father), Wild Thing's enhanced senses were pivotal in finding them. Wild Thing is considered to be almost as dangerous as her father, so many heroes give her a wide berth.<ref>''[[Last Hero Standing]]''</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Rina is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who possesses many of her father's mutant abilities including an accelerated healing factor, superhumanly acute senses, and superhuman strength, speed, agility, reflexes, coordination, balance, and endurance.  In addition to these, Rina possesses a set of "Psi-Claws", a trick she learned from her "godmother" [[Psylocke]], created from [[psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] energy, which are of similar appearance to her father's [[adamantium]] claws (and her mother's [[Sai (weapon)|sais]]), and which usually inflict damage on a mental level rather than a physical one. However, it has been shown that if she concentrates hard enough, her claws can actually slice through steel and stone. Her fighting skills are impressive, as she has been trained in martial arts from both of her parents. Her skills are sufficient to enable her to engage [[J2 (comics)|J2]] in hand-to-hand combat and hold her own, despite the advantages his much greater strength provides him.
