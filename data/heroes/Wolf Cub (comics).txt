==Fictional character biography==
===Early life===
After the deaths of his parents, Nicholas Gleason, a young [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who possesses a [[werewolf]]-like appearance, became the target of anti-mutant assassins.  Gleason was rescued by the [[X-Men]] known as [[Chamber (comics)|Chamber]] and [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and was subsequently enrolled at the Xavier Institute.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

===Struggle===
Though still a youth, Gleason has had to struggle with his feral nature. On one occasion, he attacked [[Havok (comics)|Havok]], severely injuring him in the process. In the wake of this attack, Gleason ran away from the Xavier Institute and was confronted by [[Maximus Lobo]], and other members of the werewolf pack, Dominant Species. Lobo urged the boy to leave the school and instead join Dominant Species. Though Gleason was tempted to surrender to his feral nature, he resisted those urges and assisted the X-Men and the reality-traveling team the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] in defeating Dominant Species.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

===Paragons Squad===
After the institution of the training squad system at the school, Gleason was placed onto the Paragons squad, along with fellow students [[Match (Marvel Comics)|Match]], [[Trance (comics)|Trance]], [[Preview (comics)|Preview]], [[DJ (comics)|DJ]], and [[Pixie (X-Men)|Pixie]].  After the squad lost their original advisor, [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]], they were assigned a new mentor, [[Magma (comics)|Magma]].{{issue|date=December 2012}}

===Post M-Day===
In the wake of [[House of M]], the student population of the school was dramatically reduced, causing the squad system to be dissolved and the remaining students to be merged into one group.  Gleason is one of a handful of students to retain their abilities.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

===Quest for Magik===
Wolf Cub, along with Anole, Loa, Pixie, Rockslide, and Match, were told a frightening "ghost story" by their fellow student, [[Blindfold (comics)|Blindfold]], one night at the school. It soon turned out that this tale wasn't a story at all, but rather a vision of things past and of things to come. Nick, along with his friends, was sucked down into the realm of Limbo, where they were attacked by a mob of demons. Wolf Cub held his own in this fight, using his claws and agility to kill several demons.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

===Young X-Men===
{{Main|Young X-Men}}
Wolfcub is recruited to the "Young X-Men" after Cyclops intervenes in his attempts to kill Maximus Lobo, former leader of the Dominant Species and an M-Day casualty, as revenge for his manipulation of Nicholas.  The team is given orders to take down the original New Mutants, who have gone rogue, and ordered to kill them if necessary.  When Cyclops is revealed to actually be [[Donald Pierce]] in disguise, Nicholas is shaken by his own indiscretion when following orders and his willingness to kill [[Magma (comics)|Magma]] during their confrontation.  The Young X-Men and the New Mutants engage [[Donald Pierce]], but Wolf Cub is fatally wounded, his final words pleading to [[Rockslide (comics)|Rockslide]] not to kill Pierce in revenge, as he now believes with certainty that "X-Men don't kill."<ref>''Young X-Men'' #5</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Gleason possesses a permanent werewolf-like form that imbues him with enhanced senses, strength, speed, agility, reflexes, coordination, balance and endurance. Additionally, Gleason possesses razor-sharp claws and fangs, a full-body coat of fur, and pointed ears.
