'''Shola Inkosi''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with the power of [[telekinesis]].  He first appeared in ''[[Mekanix]]'' #1, and was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Juan Bobillo]].

==Fictional character biography==
Born in [[Genosha]], Shola was smuggled out as a child as a [[Student exchange program|foreign exchange student]]. After he grew older, he attended the [[University of Chicago]]. When [[Cassandra Nova]] had "[[Sentinels (comics)|Mega-Sentinels]]" destroy Genosha, Shola lost his entire family, who had been living at the island during the time. He was left utterly alone, not only because of the loss of his family and home, but also with the revokation of his [[student visa]] when the [[United Nations]] declared Genosha a [[terrorism|terrorist]] state due to the activities of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. Also, an anti-mutant group called '''Purity''' was trying to get Shola deported and expelled from the college he was attending. To add insult to injury, Shola had been in contact with a telepath on Genosha the moment that the island was destroyed leaving him with a mental imprint of the "death-moment" of everyone who died on Genosha during the horrific attack. Every time he closes his eyes and goes into an active [[rapid eye movement sleep|rapid eye movement]] state, he experiences another first-hand death from that terrible day. As a result, he can't sleep and hasn't slept since. After the attack Shola briefly remained at the [[University of Chicago]], where he met [[Shadowcat|Kitty Pryde]] and [[Karma (comics)|Xi'an Coy Manh]] and helped them defeat a remnant of the wild Sentinels that had destroyed his home. Shola was instrumental in their destruction as Karma's telepathic powers were useless on the machines, and they quickly [[adaptation|adapted]] to Shadowcat's phasing ability.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

In his next appearance he had been captured and placed in stasis by a group of [[Magistrates]] which used to dominate the island before Magneto took over. Along with the [[Prime Sentinel]] [[Karima Shapandar]] it appeared that they were going to be the secret weapons of the Magistrates to take back the island. However the airplane that was carrying them crashed and Shola found himself on the side of the ragtag members of the newest incarnation of [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]. His abilities were indispensable to [[Professor X]] in the [[demolition]] and [[construction|reconstruction]] of his homeland.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

In the wake of [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]], where the [[Scarlet Witch]] erased the mutant [[genome]] from 90-95% of the mutant population, the members of Excalibur were depowered, then temporarily repowered by Quicksilver with the Terrigen Mists of the Inhumans.<ref>{{ Cite comic| writer = [[David Hine]]| artist = [[Roy Allan Martinez]]| title =[[Son of M]]| issue = 5| date = June 2006| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Shola is a self-described "combat telekinetic". His considerable telekinetic abilities are mostly destructive in nature, but he has also displayed precise [[fine motor skill|fine motor control]], the peak of which was obliterating a [[granite]] slab to dust, removing that dust from clothing and the surrounding environment, compacting the dust into a granite spear, then re-obliterating the spear back into dust (shown in ''Mekanix Vol. 1 (1-6)''). However, in the ''[[Excalibur (comic book)|Excalibur Vol. 3]]'' series his powers were mostly destructive.

Shola also possesses "combat telepathy" similar to [[Psylocke]], enabling him to connect, affect and manipulate the minds of other sentient beings.<ref>"Mekanix" (Vol 1) #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> Shola has soon the ability to read minds and communicate mentally with others over long distances as soon when he was able to reach to Genosha with his mind and experience the nations death as a whole during [[Cassandra Nova|Cassandra Nova's]] onslaught with her army of [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]].<ref>"Mekanix" (Vol 1) #1. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>"Excalibur" (Vol 3) #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> Although, Shola's power level of telepath is unknown it should be noted that [[Charles Xavier|Professor X]] needed to use the newly updated Cerebro, dubbed Cerebra, to contact Genosha from America while Shola only need to reach out to this home nation from Chicago. <ref>"Mekanix" (Vol 1) #1. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>"New X-Men" (Vol 1) #114-117. Marvel Comics.</ref> This task did cause him mental trauma as when he connected to the 16 million minds of Genosha he experienced the nations death as a whole during [[Cassandra Nova|Cassandra Nova's]] onslaught with her army of Sentials. The ability was usually relatively controlled except when strong emotional force triggered it - ultimately resulting in constant struggle and the inability to sleep upon the death of all mutants on Genosha during is dreams.<ref>"Mekanix" (Vol 1) #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> He powers also allow him to sense the mental state of others on an empathic level. 

==Notes==
Shola's costume in ''Excalibur'' (pictured above) is strikingly similar to the Magistrate uniform, hinting at his planned involvement in their organization.{{or|date=December 2012}}
