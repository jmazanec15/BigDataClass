'''Nara''' is a fictional character from [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
Nara first appeared in issue #1 of the ''[[Avengers Arena]]'' series as part of the ''[[Marvel NOW!]]'' event, and was created by [[Dennis Hopeless]] and [[Kev Walker]].

==Fictional character biography==
Nara is an [[Homo mermanus|Atlantean]] that attended the Braddock Academy (England's version of the [[Avengers Academy]]). She was secretly dating [[Kid Briton]], even though he was in a relationship with [[Apex (comics)|Katy Bashir]] at that time. Nara is one of sixteen teenagers kidnapped by [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]] who forces them to fight each other to the death in his latest version of Murderworld.<ref>''Avengers Arena'' #1</ref> She is part of the Braddock Academy group (consisting of Apex, Kid Briton, [[Anachronism (comics)|Anachronism]] and [[Cullen Bloodstone|Bloodstone]]) which is joined by [[Deathlocket|Death Locket]] despite death threats from Kid Briton and Nara. Death Locket started bonding with Apex as she introduces her to the rest of the Braddock Academy.<ref>''Avengers Arena'' #2</ref> There is discord in the Braddock Academy's ranks as Anachronism and Kid Briton get into an argument. An earthquake then separates Bloodstone and Anachronism from Apex, Nara, Kid Briton, and Death Locket. Death Locket goes dormant as her cybernetics take over and she blasts Nara off a cliff and into the ocean. Kid Briton is enraged by this and tries to kill her until Apex orders him not to, revealing that she knew about his affair with Nara back at the Braddock Academy and that "we're here now and I'm done sharing." <ref>''Avengers Arena'' #5</ref> Nara, Anachronism, and Bloodstone manage to survive falling into the chasm and come to the conclusion that Apex is manipulating Death Locket and Kid Briton to her own ends. The trio is then teleported by Arcade to the supply cache at Quadrant 2 just as Apex, Death Locket, and Kid Briton arrive. Nara and Apex start arguing and Apex confirms that she was the one who ordered Death Locket to attack Nara. Kid Briton tries to intervene as Nara continues calling him a "weak puppet." An irate Kid Briton attempts to kill Nara for insulting him only to be beheaded by Anachronism.<ref>''Avengers Arena'' #6</ref>

After being injured by Apex, [[Nico Minoru|Nico]] sacrifices herself by staying behind in order to get the other survivors to safety.<ref>''Avengers Arena'' #10</ref> The remaining teenage heroes catch up to [[Reptil]] and [[Hazmat (comics)|Hazmat]] and are invited to have shark steaks with them. Cullen Bloodstone confronts Reptil about their camping out on the beach while a war's going off elsewhere. [[Cammi (comics)|Cammi]] interjects to agree with Cullen Bloodstone before saying she's heading out to either find Nico or avenge her. Reptil heads back to shake Hazmat out of her funk. Everyone agrees to go back out into Murderworld.<ref>''Avengers Arena'' #11</ref>

When Cullen Bloodstone's ring is knocked into the ocean, Nara dives into the ocean to find it. Nara recalls when her parents were part of [[Namor]]'s Royal Guards although they were actually agents of [[Attuma]]. After her parents were discovered and killed, Namor tells Nara to trust only herself. Upon going to the surface world, Nara is enrolled at the Braddock Academy. Nara is killed when trying to stop a rampaging Cullen (in his Glaratrox form). After Cullen is subdued and returned to human form, Nara dies in Anachronism's arms.<ref>''Avengers Arena'' #15</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Like all Atlanteans, Nara is amphibious. She wears a special helmet to breathe on land.
