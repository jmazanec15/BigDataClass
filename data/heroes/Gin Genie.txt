'''Gin Genie''' ('''Rebecca "Beckah" Parker''') is a [[fictional character]], [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] superhero appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was depicted as a member of the second team of [[X-Force]].  She was created by [[Peter Milligan]] (writer) and [[Mike Allred]] (artist).  Her first appearance was in ''X-Force'' #116 (July 2001).

==Fictional character biography==
Gin Genie is already a well-established superhero when she first appears in the pages of X-Force with her teammates.  There is tension, as [[U-Go Girl]] states that 'being a fan' of Gin Genie is similar to posting one's Alcoholics Anonymous records on the internet.{{issue|date=September 2017}}

Her first shown mission with the group is to [[North Africa]].  They battle drug-addled tribesmen who are attempting to overthrow the local government. During the mission, Genie's teammate [[Sluk]] dies in a tank explosion. Genie herself gets a low performance rating, as her alcohol mixing produces dangerous tremors.{{issue|date=September 2017}}

Later at home, she gets performance anxiety. [[Plazm]] uses her powers to help calm her down.  She is also shown worrying about her skin and how it would look for TV.{{issue|date=September 2017}}

===Death===
X-Force's main leader, [[Coach (comics)|Coach]] arranges for a mission that would gain lots of publicity, easily.  Or so he says.  The manufactured boy band 'Boys R Us' has been taken hostage in the Sonic TV studios, set deep in the city.  Already, one of them has been killed.  The terrorists, who just want money, are deemed perfect adversaries.{{issue|date=September 2017}}

The team teleports in and all is going as planned until a helicopter gunship opens fire.  Genie, the terrorists, the hostages and most of X-Force all die. The only survivors are [[Anarchist (comics)|Anarchist]] and [[U-Go Girl]]. The latter sends the copter crew plunging to their deaths.{{issue|date=September 2017}}

==Powers and abilities==
Beckah could project energy to create tremors within the ground.  There was some indication that alcohol helped or increased her powers.
