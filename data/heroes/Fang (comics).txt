'''Fang''' is the name of three fictional extraterrestrial characters appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The first character first appeared in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #107 in October 1977 and was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Dave Cockrum]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Original version===
Fang is a Lupak who was a member of the Royal Elite of the [[Shi'ar]] [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Imperial Guard]]. He joined the other Imperial Guardsmen in battle against the [[X-Men]] on behalf of Emperor [[D'Ken]] on a nameless Shi'ar Empire planet. He was attacked by [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], who defeated him and stripped him of his costume, using it to sneak up on the other Imperial Guardsmen.<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 1 #107</ref>

Fang later became a "Borderer": a Guardsman stationed on one of the Shi'ar's conquered worlds to help its governor enforce Shi'ar law there.  Fang and a small number of other Guardsmen became renegades and turned traitor, betraying the Shi'ar Empire by serving [[Deathbird]] in her attempt to overthrow her sister Princess-Majestrix [[Lilandra Neramani|Lilandra]]. This incident involves ''Lord Samedar'' attempting to use some of the outlaw Guard in order to attack the Earth. His faction is opposed by other Shi'ar and the X-Men, the renegade Guardsmen battling the loyal Guardsmen, and Fang fighting [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] during the conflict. The [[Brood (comics)|Brood]] interfere with a concussion-style bomb secretly hidden in the midst of the battle.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #157</ref>

Soon after this incident, Fang is apparently slain when the Brood uses him as a host body for the egg of one of their young on the "Broodworld," former home-world of the Brood. His body is consumed and transformed by the Brood embryo implanted inside him, and the resulting Brood alien later fought Wolverine who killed it.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #162</ref>

In ''Untold Tales of Captain Marvel'' — which takes place before his first encounter with the X-Men — Fang, the Guard, Marvel and the Kree face an attack by the Brood. A small division of the Guard, Deathbolt, Smasher, Fang and Oracle had been selected to guard the personage of Deathbird, the current ruler of the Shi'ar empire. They allied, then fought with the Kree after the latter came to their assistance against a murderous attack from the Skrulls.<ref>''Untold Tales Of Captain Marvel'' #1-3 (1997)</ref>

Fang is seen as loyal Shi'ar warrior when they go to war with the Inhuman-led Kree. One of many battles in this war led Fang and many others to the base of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy]], a giant flowing head called [[Knowhere]].<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #14 (2011)</ref>

Fang is one of the many Shi'ar soldiers assigned to team up with the Starjammers to investigate 'The Fault'. This is a space-time anomaly that not only threatens Shi'ar space, but all of reality.<ref>''Realm of Kings: Imperial Guard'' #1-5 (2011)</ref>

Fang would reappear years later on Earth alive and well, he came to visit Wolverine only to discover that his [[Death of Wolverine|old buddy had died]]. Fang eventually revealed all his history with Logan to [[X-23]] even revealing how he came back to life after being killed by the Brood. According to Fang himself, the Lupak reproduce through cloning and keep mental templates of the citizens on file. When one of them dies, a new one is made. He even reveals to X-23 that while technically he's not the Fang Wolverine met since he's a clone, he is still the one Wolverine knew.<ref>''Wolverines'' #11 (2015)</ref>

Fang assists the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] and Laura Kinney, who was operating as Wolverine, in stopping a Brood infestation of a scientific facility.<ref>''All-New Wolverine'' #22-24 (2017)</ref>

===Shi'ar criminal===
A different Fang appears as a criminal of the Shi'ar Empire. She was released from prison to target the Shi'ar traitor Cerise.<ref>''Excalibur'' #69</ref> When she tried to kill Cerise's friend and fellow prisoner Cryan, Fang was killed by Cerise.<ref>''Excalibur'' #70</ref>

===Nev-Darr===
When the original Fang was killed, another Lupak named Nev-Darr was enlisted to take the place of the original Fang on the Imperial Guard.<ref>''Starjammers'' #4</ref>

During the ''[[War of Kings]]'' storyline, Fang was with the Imperial Guard when it came to fighting the forces of [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]]<ref>''War of Kings'' #1</ref>

After dying in an unseen battle, Fang's body was found by the Kree Pursuer Corps.<ref>''All-New Invaders'' #</ref>{{issue|date=November 2017}}

===Third version===
A third Fang joined the Imperial Guard and was first seen with them when they apprehended [[Drax the Destroyer]].<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' Vol. 3 #15</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Fang's strength, speed, stamina, durability, agility, and reflexes are higher than that of the average human. He is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant, having been trained by the [[Shi'ar]] [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Imperial Guard]]. Fang later possessed abilities like flying through space, energy manipulation, and teleportation.

Imperial Guardsmen wear small anti-gravity devices permitting them to fly, designed by Shi'ar scientists and technicians.

==Inspiration==
Several of the members of the Imperial Guard are at least partly based on members of the [[DC Comics]] team [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]. (Dave Cockrum, co-creator of the Guard, also had a long run as artist on the Legion.) Fang is based on LSH member [[Timber Wolf (comics)|Timber Wolf]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

==Other characters named Fang==
===World War II villain===
During [[World War II]], an unnamed man who was known as Fang was part of [[Imperial Japan]]'s spy network. While stationed in [[San Francisco]]'s [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]] district, Fang worked to undermine North America's interests prior to the day they joined World War II. When he targeted two Chinese emissaries, Fang and his hatchet-men ran afoul of [[Captain America]] and [[Bucky Barnes|Bucky]]. They defeated Fang and his henchmen and handed them over to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]].<ref>''Captain America Comics'' #6</ref>

In the modern era, [[Super-Adaptoid]] later assumed the form of Fang in order to confuse Captain America. Though it was claimed by Captain America that Fang was apparently killed during the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]].<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #82</ref>

===Snake===
The Fang was a snake of legend that goes out into the jungle every 10 years to bite people. After her friend Greg Knight was bitten by Fang where it's poison will kill him in 3 hours, [[Lorna the Jungle Girl]] tracked down fang and killed it. Then Lorna's native friend M'Tuba made an anti-poison from it so that he can cure Greg.<ref>''Lorna the Jungle Girl'' #7</ref>

===Lilin version===
Fang is a Lilin who is the descendant of Lilith.<ref>''Morbius the Living Vampire'' #1</ref>

==Other versions==
* In the ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'' reality, Fang was with the Imperial Guard when they fought Gambit and the X-Ternals upon their arrival to obtain the M'Kraan Crystal.<ref>''Gambit and the X-Ternals'' #2</ref>
