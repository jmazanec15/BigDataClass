'''Marvel Boy''' is the name of several [[fictional character|fictional]] [[comic book]] characters in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]], including predecessor companies [[Timely Comics]] and [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]].

==Martin Burns==
'''Martin Burns''' is the 1940s Marvel Boy. After a mysterious shadow revealed to him that he possessed the power of [[Hercules]], he became a superhero. The character made only two appearances: ''[[Daring Mystery Comics]]'' #6 (June 1940), by the writer-artist collaborators [[Joe Simon]] & [[Jack Kirby]], and ''[[USA Comics]]'' #7 (Feb. 1943), by [[writer]]-[[artist]] [[Bob Oksner]]. Each featured a wildly disparate version of his origin, with the first positing him as the [[reincarnation]] of the mythic [[ancient Greece|Greek]] [[demigod]], while the second had him accidentally scratched by Hercules' [[mummy|mummified remains]] in a museum and "infected' with his superhuman strength, although both versions shared the basics noted above.<ref>[http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/m/marvelboyga1.htm Marvel Boy (Martin Burns)] at the International Catalogue of Superheroes</ref> The ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]: [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] 2004'' reconciles these different origins by stating that there were two Marvel Boys named Martin Burns active in the 1940s.

==Robert Grayson==
{{main|Marvel Boy (Robert Grayson)}}
'''Robert Grayson''' is the 1950s Marvel Boy, debuting in ''Marvel Boy'' #1 (Dec. 1950), from Marvel 1950s forerunner, [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]]. He continued to appear when the series title was changed to ''Astonishing'' with issue #3. Created by writer-[[editing|editor]] [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Russ Heath]], with writer-artist [[Bill Everett]] taking over with issue #2, this Marvel Boy is the son of Dr. Horace Grabshield (later Anglicized as Grayson), a scientist who fled Earth to [[Uranus]] with his infant son during the rise of [[Nazi Germany]]. His final story during this period was in ''Astonishing'' #7 (Dec. 1951). He returned in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #165 (Dec. 1975) under the name "The Crusader", and appeared in the 12-issue ensemble [[miniseries]] ''[[Marvel: The Lost Generation]]'' (March 2000 - Feb. 2001) and elsewhere, eventually joining the superhero group [[Agents of Atlas]].<ref>[http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/m/marvelboyatlas.htm Marvel Boy (Robert Grayson)] at the International Catalogue of Superheroes</ref><ref>[http://www.toonopedia.com/marvlboy.htm Marvel Boy (Robert Grayson)] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]]</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20091026210034/http://www.geocities.com/ratmmjess/mboy3.html Marvel Boy (Robert Grayson)] at the Guide to Marvel's Pre-FF #1 Heroes</ref>

==Wendell Vaughn==
{{main|Quasar (Wendell Vaughn)}}
'''Wendell Elvis Vaughn''', an agent in the Marvel Comics [[espionage]] agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], became the 1970s Marvel Boy in ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' #217 (Jan. 1978), when he became bonded to the 1950s character's "quantum band" bracelets. The bands had been remanded to S.H.I.E.L.D. after the events of ''The Fantastic Four'' #165, above. His codename was quickly changed to '''Marvel Man''' as part of the agency's short-lived Super-Agent program. He changed it to '''[[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]]''' in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' #234 (April 1979).

==Vance Astrovik==
{{main|Vance Astrovik}}
'''Vance Astrovik''' was the 1980s Marvel Boy. He used the Marvel Boy codename for some time before being sent to prison in the pages of ''[[New Warriors]]''. He later adopted the codename '''Justice'''.

==David Bank==
{{main|Marvel Boy (David Bank)}}
'''David Bank''' is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe, who can fly and project energy blasts. He first appeared in ''[[Vance Astrovik|Justice: Four Balance]]'' #4 (1994). '''David Bank''' took on the name of [[Marvel Boy (David Bank)|Marvel Boy]] in the closing issue of a series featuring Vance Astrovik, the previous Marvel Boy.

==Noh-Varr==
{{main|Noh-Varr}}
While never using the name Marvel Boy, [[Noh-Varr]] was introduced in a 2000 [[Limited series (comics)|miniseries]] of that title by writer [[Grant Morrison]] and artist [[J. G. Jones]]. He is an alien of the pink-skinned version of [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] [[Kree]], although he hails from [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate reality]]. Upon arriving on Earth, he became an [[anti-hero]] with elements of teenage rebellion.
