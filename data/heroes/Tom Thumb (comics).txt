'''Tom Thumb''' is the name of two fictional characters appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
The Earth-712 Tom Thumb first appeared in ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #85 and was created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[John Buscema]].

==Concept==
While the Squadron Supreme is based on the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] [[Justice League]], Tom Thumb is closer to the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] [[Atom (Al Pratt)|Atom]]; a very short adventurer with no superpowers. Though he is a surprisingly skilled and agile fighter for his size, his greatest similarity to the Silver Age version is that he is a brilliant scientist.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

==Fictional character biography==

===Squadron Supreme version===
Thomas Thompson was a [[dwarfism|dwarf]] scientist, inventor, adventurer, and member of the superhero team [[Squadron Supreme]]. He was born in Melzburg, Danteana, on [[Earth-712]]. His main contribution to the team was his scientific genius. He designed the Squadron's headquarters and frequently created advanced devices such as a Behavior Modifying Machine that could be used on criminals to change their ways, and a [[Force field (science fiction)|force field]] belt that protected its wearer and could even deflect bullets.

Tom Thumb first encountered the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] years ago. With the Squadron Supreme and the Avengers, he battled [[Brain-Child]].<ref>''Avengers'' #85-86</ref> With the Squadron, he fell under control of the Serpent Cartel. The Squadron battled the Avengers on behalf of the Serpent Cartel, then turned against the Cartel.<ref>''Avengers'' #148-149</ref> Alongside the other Squadron members, he became mind-controlled by the [[Overmind (comics)|Over-Mind]]. He was used along with the other members as pawns in the Over-Mind's conquest of "Other-Earth," but was freed by the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. With the Squadron and Defenders, he battled and defeated the Over-Mind and [[Null, the Living Darkness]].<ref>''Defenders'' #112-114</ref>

Alongside the Squadron Supreme, Tom Thumb assumed control of the government of the United States of "Other-Earth", and publicly revealed his true identity.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #1</ref> He was asked by [[Nuke (Squadron Supreme)|Nuke]], another member of the Squadron, to find a cure for his parents' cancer, but failed. After running a test on the radiation emitted by Nuke, Thumb realized he (along with anyone else who had spent extended periods of time in proximity to Nuke) developed terminal [[cancer]]. He refused to kill [[Hyperion (comics)|Hyperion]] in exchange for a cure from the [[Scarlet Centurion]], and Nuke swore vengeance on Thumb.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #2</ref> Tom Thumb then completed the Behavior Modification Machine.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #3</ref> He was captured by the [[Institute of Evil]], and voted to expel the [[Golden Archer]] from the Squadron.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #5-6</ref> Tom Thumb stole the Scarlet Centurion's "panacea potion," but discovered it was ineffective to cure his cancer. Unable to invent a cure, Thumb ultimately died at the team's headquarters in Squadron City and was placed in the Hibernaculum, a form of [[suspended animation]] he invented to preserve the bodies of diseased or recently deceased persons until a remedy could be found for whatever disease or injury that could not be treated by present-day medicine.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #9-10</ref>

===Supreme Power===

In '''Supreme Power''' Wyatt McDonald is one of a number of convicts who had volunteered to act as [[Human subject research|test subjects]] for a military experiment. Tom Thumb first appeared in a flashback in ''[[Supreme Power]]'', a [[Reboot (continuity)|reboot]] of the Squadron Supreme.

The flashback showed a number of convicts who had volunteered to act as [[Human subject research|test subjects]] for a military experiment. The experiment was designed to graft a [[retrovirus]] based on the [[DNA]] of [[Hyperion (Supreme Power)|Hyperion]], an [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] and superhero of ambiguous origins, to human subjects. One of the subjects was Wyatt McDonald, and the retrovirus' effects made Wyatt shrink to a height of less than an inch (2.54 centimeters), though his size seems to have fluctuated since. To compensate for his diminished stature, Wyatt has a belligerent, confrontational attitude, daring his larger opponents to try something.

After being recruited to the government's Squadron Supreme superhuman group, McDonald was going to be a member of the [[covert]] team and started thinking it would be similar to a [[James Bond]] movie. However, [[Master Menace|Doctor Emil Burbank]] made a tiny, self-contained [[suppository]] capsule with enough air to last the mission, which was inserted into [[Shape (comics)|Shape]] as a backup plan. After the mission in Africa, Tom Thumb is now in counseling to help him deal with the self-contained capsule experience.

==Powers and abilities==
Tom Thumb has an extraordinary genius level of intellect, but no superhuman powers.  He is an expert and innovator in a wide range of scientific and technological fields, including computer science, medicine, psychology, force field technology, and spacecraft design. He possessed total recall and great physical dexterity. He is highly skilled at manipulating various weaponry of his own design.  He possesses PhDs in mathematics, physics, and electrical engineering. Tom Thumb has access to a variety of technologies that he has designed. He used a one-man flying vehicle that was equipped with various advanced weaponry, including guns firing concussive energy blasts. His inventions included [[AIDA (comics)|A.I.D.A.]] (Artificially Intelligent Data Analyzer), a highly advanced computer with a human-like personality and sentience; the Behavior Modification Machine, which could alter the personalities and thinking processes of human powers; the Hibernaculum, a means of storing a human body in suspended animation; and the Transtemporal Somnaprojector, a means of time travel. He also invented and wore a personal force field belt, which projected a protective field of energy about the wearer that could even deflect bullets.

Although not a scientist, the ''Supreme Power'' version of Tom Thumb is similar to the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Silver Age Atom]] in that he has achieved minuscule size. He has been depicted at a variety of sizes, ranging from insect to action figure scale. However, it is unclear at this time whether Tom is able to return to normal human dimensions.

==Other versions==
A version of Tom Thumb was a member of the Squadron Supreme of Earth-13034. He and the Squadron Supreme were killed due to Earth-13034's incursion with another Earth resulting in Hyperion being the only survivor.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 5 #4</ref>
