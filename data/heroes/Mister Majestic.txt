==Fictional character biography==
Mr. Majestic, born Majestros on the planet Khera, Majestic was a [[Kherubim]] warlord. He has two children, Kenesha and Majestrate. Kenesha was born out of a union with Majestros and Lady Zannah ([[Zealot (Wildstorm)|Zealot]]) on Khera. However Zannah could not stay a warrior if she became a mother. Thus Zannah gave Kenesha to her mother to raise, allowing Majestros to believe Kenesha was Zannah's sister, rather than his own daughter.

Majestic was one of the four Kherubim lords trapped on earth during the Kherubim/[[Daemonite]] war. It is later revealed that he took his son with him on this journey (see [[#Majestrate|Majestrate below]]).  He spent centuries fighting for justice and eventually joined the government sponsored [[Team One]] during the [[cold war]].  While the team was fighting Lord [[Helspont]] and the Cabal, Majestros was forced to kill his friend and fellow Kheran Yon Kohl (also known as John Colt).  This event caused him to seek solitude in the [[Arctic]].  It was only years later that Savant asked him to help Zealot in her battle with Tapestry.  And thus Mr. Majestic made his return to the civilized world.

When Jim Lee was asked why he based Mr. Majestic so much on Superman, he stated that he was tired of seeing so many comic heroes who possessed great power but were too afraid to use it.  Mr. Majestic possesses powers similar to those of Superman, but his personality is entirely different.  Majestros has more militant views, as he is a Kheran [[warlord]].  The difference between the two is further portrayed when Majestros finds himself stuck on Superman’s Earth.  The two have an interesting conversation about Majestic’s no-nonsense, all-business personality and Superman’s more subtle approach to things.  Subjects they discuss include the fact that Majestic put superhuman villains in prison without giving them a fair trial and getting into bouts with that world’s heroes, claiming he finds them dismayingly reticent.

==WildC.A.T.s era==
During his tenure as leader of the WildC.A.T.s, Majestic led the team in a completely new direction, brutally punishing criminals both superhuman and non-superhuman alike.  After Tao caused a big gang war, Majestros quit the team.  He rejoined at the request of Grifter at the end of WildC.A.T.s v1, but didn't stay long.

==Solo series==
In 2003, Wildstorm published a series called ''Mr. Majestic.'' In this series it is revealed that Majestic did not spend the majority of his time after Team One in solitude, but rather as a government agent taking on paranormal anomalies with the aid of a gifted boy named Desmond.  In the issues of this comic, much is revealed about Majestic’s time after the [[Cold War]], as his adventures span from the late 1960s to the early 2000s.  When he is flung into [[Metropolis]] by Daemonite technology, Majestros takes on the alias of Jim McArest (an [[anagram]] of "Mr. Majestic"), as he had suffered amnesia from the interdimensional trip.  In 2005, Majestic (with the aid of Superman) returned to the WildStorm universe in an ongoing solo-series called ''Majestic''.

In ''Mr. Majestic'' (vol. 1) issue #4, it was revealed that Majestros has a son named Majestrate whom he took along from Khera (although the mother is not mentioned).  Majestrate’s body did not survive the crash landing, but his mind was preserved in a crystal.  Majestic obtained a substance called "starstuff" from another [[dimension]] in order to transfer his son’s mind into a new artificial body.  The reunion was one of the rare occasions Majestic showed any emotion.  The joy that both father and son experienced would however be short-lived.  The fact that starstuff was in another [[dimension]] caused an interdimensional imbalance, an imbalance that tried to correct itself by manifesting in [[Australia]] in a man named Freddie Noondyke.  It would soon become apparent that for the imbalance to be corrected, the starstuff in Majestrate’s body would have to be returned, thus ending the boy’s life.  Majestic would hear nothing of it at first, until his son convinced him that it was the right thing to do.  Majestrate flew into the dimensional maelstrom and brought the imbalance to an end.  When Majestic flew down, he found the metal skeleton of the artificial body.  The result of this loss led to Majestros being in a depressed mood for quite some time.

==Savant==
In WildStorm Winter Special, it was revealed that Kenesha, also known as Savant, is in fact the daughter of Majestros and Zealot.  Kherans have become nearly [[infertile]] over their long history and therefore have a ritual where a young female and male Kheran are coupled for one night.  If the female is impregnated, she becomes a [[wikt:priestess|priestess]].  Zealot became pregnant after the arranged night with Majestros.  Her mother protected Zealot's wish to become a warrior by claiming to be the mother of the child herself.  Majestros seems to be unaware of his true relationship towards Savant as it is a well-guarded secret.  Zealot and Majestic have never mentioned their night together to anybody else.

==Powers and abilities==
Majestic possesses powers fairly similar to those of Superman:  great strength, speed, flight, eyebeams, genius level intellect, micro vision, ice breath, ability to survive in space, accelerated healing, and invulnerability to conventional weaponry.  Majestic's strength and durability vary from appearance to appearance.  Unlike Superman, Majestic has the ability to shoot energy beams from his hands.  In ''WildC.A.T.s''#17, his hand is shown shining with energy, while money bags levitate around him, suggesting telekinesis.  Majestros is a [[genius]], able to construct any device within a matter of seconds, analyze a situation and come up with the proper solution, and find weaknesses in enemies.  Majestic is also a skilled warrior, especially in the use of bladed weapons, like most Kherubim warriors.

Majestic did not begin life at these power levels and it revealed in the ''Backlash'' and ''Wildcore'' series that he was altered by the alien race known as the D'rahn who have the power to evolve beings to achieve powerful potentials.

Superhumans in the WildStorm Universe are apparently categorized into named "classes". Characters such as [[Apollo (comics)|Apollo]] and The High are considered to be "Majestic-Class superhumans", presumably a class based on Majestros himself.

==Related fictional locations==
Majestic has a secret base of operations inside [[Mount Rushmore]], analogous to [[Superman]]'s "[[Fortress of Solitude]]".

==In other media==
Majestic appears in the ''[[Wild C.A.T.s]]'' animated series.
