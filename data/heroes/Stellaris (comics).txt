==Fictional character biography==
Her exact origins largely unknown even to herself, Stellaris travels the universe seeking vengeance against the god-like [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]] whom she claims destroyed her home world after judging it "unfit". Eventually her travels lead her to Earth when she pursues a Replicoid, a messenger of the Celestials sent to Earth to summon the heroes [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] to the "Black Galaxy". After finding the messenger, she destroys it out of her hatred for the Celestials.<ref>''The Mighty Thor'', Vol. 1 #419 (July 1990)'''</ref> Stellaris fought [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] and was defeated by [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. The pair allowed her to escape when she threatened to destroy the Earth.<ref>''Thor'' #421</ref> Stellaris secretly entered the [[High Evolutionary]]'s starship ''New Wundagore'', where she freed [[Nobilus]].<ref>''Thor'' #422</ref> Stellaris escaped with Nobilus, and follows Hercules and Thor to the Black Galaxy to kill the Red Celestial.<ref>''Thor'' #423</ref> In the Black Galaxy, she found a group of Celestials in the process of bringing to life a new Celestial. Stellaris attacks intending to destroy the new Celestial by setting off an enormous explosion, only to find she has inadvertently provided the final energy needed to allow the new Celestial to come to life.<ref>''The Mighty Thor'', Vol. 1 #424 (October 1990)'''</ref> She later recovered, and returned to Earth to kill Thor. She fought the original Thor and the third Thor, and then decided to "relax" on Earth for a while.<ref>''Thor'' #438-439</ref>

Some time after her encounter with the Celestials in the Black Galaxy, Stellaris shadows for a period of time on Earth [[Thunderstrike (Eric Masterson)|Eric Masterson]], a mortal human who had been bonded with Thor at the time when Thor and Stellaris first encountered one another. Stellaris covertly aids Masterson in his adventures as the hero "Thunderstrike" before returning to space once again in order to seek clues to her origin.<ref>''Thunderstrike'' #16 (January 1995)'''</ref>

When the interdimensional villain, [[Annihilus]], [[Annihilation (comics)|invades outer space]] Stellaris submits herself to super powered extraterrestrial [[Gamora]] becoming one of Gamora's "Graces" to order to oppose the threat. During a battle in the conflict with [[Ronan the Accuser]], Stellaris was seriously wounded.<ref>''Annihilation: Ronan'' #2 (July 2006)'''</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Stellaris is an athletic woman with no superhuman powers, although she is skilled in her native world's equivalent of street-fighting techniques. Stellaris possesses a suit of "living" armor of unknown origin and composition. In one story her armor was assessed by a robot to be identical to the armor of the Celestials.<ref>''The Mighty Thor'', Vol. 1 #424 (October 1990)'''</ref> She can mentally will the armor to reshape itself to her specifications, and even cause it to increase or decrease in size and mass. Hence, she can cause the armor to become much larger and more massive than herself, cause it instead resemble a form-fitting jumpsuit, or even cause it to take on the appearance of normal terrestrial clothing. Stellaris can also will the armor to form a vast array of weaponry and vehicles. Examples so far observed include armament that fires blasts of concussive energy and intense heat and a "sonic shatter-pistol." She can cause part of her battlesuit to become an advanced skycycle or even to become a vehicle resembling a normal Earth motorcycle that can nevertheless fly through the air. Stellaris's battlesuit is said to contain power on the level of the [[Silver Surfer]]'s. The battlesuit contains a self-destruct system that will cause the battlesuit to implode, releasing enough concussive force to destroy a planet.  The battlesuit is capable of both atmospheric flight and interstellar travel.
