'''Thornn''' ('''Lucia Callasantos''') is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was created for their series, ''[[X-Force]]''. She was one of the few [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]] to survive the [[Mutant Massacre]] and is the sister of former X-Force member, [[Feral (comics)|Feral]]. Both had been depowered in the wake of [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], however, both have returned to their mutant forms (albeit without powers).

==Fictional character biography==
Thornn made her first appearance in ''X-Force'' (vol.1) #6 as a member of the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]] under the leadership of [[Masque (comics)|Masque]].<ref>''X-Force'' (vol.1) #6</ref> [[Toad (comics)|Toad]], then the leader of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], was trying to form an alliance with the group of social outcasts, and it was Thornn's vote that swayed the opinion of the Morlocks. If they wanted to get what was theirs by right, then they needed to take it by force. Their first course of action would be to go after the defected Morlock, [[Feral (comics)|Feral]]. They are soundly defeated and Thornn is returned to the Morlocks with a warning from [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] to never mess with X-Force again.{{Issue|date=January 2010}}

Later when [[Mikhail Rasputin]] flooded the Morlock Tunnels, Thornn again was one of the few survivors. She attempted to save a young [[Marrow (comics)|Marrow]], but wasn't able to hold on to her with the rushing waters. Thornn was distraught and continued to search the tunnels for survivors, having no luck because Mikhail had transported a number of the Morlocks to a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel dimension]] called the ''Hill''. Running out of options, she contacted Cable and [[Domino (comics)|Domino]] to help her perform a ritual called the ''Ceremony of Lights''â€”a practice where light illuminates the ''Alley'' by a series of cleverly placed mirrors and glass shards. When the Alley was illuminated the young form of Marrow appeared through dimensional walls to let Thornn know that there were Morlocks who had survived but they were too scared to come out of hiding.{{Issue|date=January 2010}}

Thornn also aided X-Force in the capture of her rogue sister on one occasion. During this episode, it was revealed that Feral had killed several members of their family, including their stepfather, mother, and little brother (never proven but strongly implied). It was also made known that their stepfather had [[child molestation|sexually molested]] both of the sisters.{{Issue|date=January 2010}}

Next, Thornn made an unexpected alliance with [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] and joined the [[Mumbai]] branch of [[X-Corporation]] along with her sister, former X-Force member [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]], and [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]]. The team helped save [[Professor X]] from an [[assassination]] attempt by a crazed [[Lilandra|Lilandra Neramani]], who still believed that Charles Xavier was [[Cassandra Nova]].<ref>New X-Men #133.</ref>

She appears later, after the incident known as [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], where the [[Scarlet Witch]] caused the mutant [[gene]] to disappear from 90-95% of the mutant population worldwide, making them "baseline humans". Both Thornn and her sister were shown to be depowered.{{Issue|date=January 2010}}

Thornn recently appeared alongside her sister, [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]] and [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]] in Wakanda offering their assistance to [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] against [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]]. Both Thornn and Feral were mysteriously returned to their powered forms, with no memory as to how this occurred. While Wolverine searches for answers inside the [[Weapon X]] facility, Thornn and her allies are attacked and critically wounded by Sabretooth and [[Wild Child (comics)|Wild Child]]. Feral was subsequently murdered by Sabretooth.{{Issue|date=January 2010}}

With Feral dead, Wolfsbane speculates that the sisters had never regained their powers, rather, they had simply been returned to their animalistic forms. Wolverine took this as fact, as it explained how Feral was defeated by Sabretooth so easily. The enigmatic Romulus had the genetic skills to revert the sisters to their mutant forms.{{Issue|date=January 2010}}

==Powers and abilities==
Formerly had a feline mutation that endowed her with a thin layer of orange and white fur covering her body, sharp claws and fangs, pointed ears, enhanced senses, [[night vision]], strength, speed, agility, reflexes, coordination, balance, endurance and healing ability as well as a [[prehensile]] tail. Depowered during [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].
