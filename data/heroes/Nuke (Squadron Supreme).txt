'''Nuke''' is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is depicted as being from Earth-712, a member of the [[Squadron Supreme]] and later its rebooted equivalent, [[Supreme Power]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Squadron Supreme===
Albert Gaines was born in a suburb of Motor City, Wyandota (the [[Earth-712]] equivalent of [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]), where his father and mother lived. Albert was a nuclear plant worker when he accidentally gained his superhuman powers.{{Fact|date=March 2009}} He became '''Nuke''', an adventurer and member of the [[Squadron Supreme]], and a super-powered hero who kept his identity a secret from even his own family.

Alongside the other Squadron members, he became mind-controlled by the [[Overmind (comics)|Over-Mind]]. He was used along with the other members as pawns in the Over-Mind's conquest of "Other-Earth," until he was freed by the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. He battled and defeated the Over-Mind and [[Null, the Living Darkness|Null the Living Darkness]] alongside the Squadron and the Defenders.<ref>''Defenders'' (vol. 1) #112-114</ref>

Alongside the Squadron Supreme, Nuke assumed control of the government of the United States of "Other-Earth," and publicly revealed his true identity.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' (vol. 1) #1</ref> Nuke then found out that his parents were dying from radiation poisoning, brought on by exposure to his own powers. Nuke turned to [[Tom Thumb (comics)#Squadron Supreme|Tom Thumb]] to help find a cure for them; however, when Tom could not find a cure for cancer, Nuke vowed revenge on Tom.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' (vol. 1) #2</ref> Nuke went insane with grief over his parents' death, and went on a rampage. [[Doctor Spectrum#Joseph Ledger (Earth-712)|Doctor Spectrum]], however, tried to hold Nuke back and prevent him from murdering Tom Thumb, by encasing him in one of his energy bubble constructs, accidentally killing him when Nuke's use of his own powers burned up the oxygen supply inside the bubble and he suffocated.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' (vol. 1) #3</ref>

===Supreme Power===
Nuke is introduced as Mr. Al Gaines, a young, severely depressed man living underground in a fallout shelter alone because his body emits high levels of radiation he cannot control.{{Issue|date=March 2009}} He is near invulnerable, can fly, and apparently superhumanly strong. General Alexander offers him a suit that will control his radiation output in return for fighting [[Hyperion (Supreme Power)|Hyperion]], whom General Alexander directs the blame for his condition.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

In a fight with [[Hyperion (Supreme Power)|Hyperion]] the combination of Hyperion's eye-beams, Nuke's radiation blast, and [[Arcanna]] Jones' quantum alterations creates a brief and unexplainable skip in reality that sends Gaines, Jones, Dr. [[Emil Burbank]] and [[Shape (comics)|Raleigh Lund]] two years into the future.{{issue|date=January 2013}} An off-hand remark noted that [[Doctor Spectrum]] will kill Nuke at some point.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Nuke has joined the government's Squadron Supreme.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' (vol. 2) #1</ref> During a session in which all the Squadron members were asked to fill out information about themselves, Nuke's parents were revealed deceased.{{issue|date=January 2013}} In the first mission he is high up in the sky to be used as a tactical nuke, the person of last resort.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

==Powers and abilities==
Albert Gaines was imbued with superhuman powers as a result of mutation through exposure to radioactive waste products. He thus had the ability to generate nuclear energy within his body through nuclear decay. Hence, his body continually gave off low-level radiation, although this level became much higher over the last year of his life. Nuke himself was immune to adverse effects of radiation. He could mentally manipulate the nuclear energy generated and stored within his body. He could project destructive bursts of radiation from his body. He could fly by propelling himself with nuclear energy. Towards the end of his life, Nuke also wore an air-conditioned radiation containment suit equipped with a radiometer to measure his radiation output, designed by Tom Thumb. Nuke was a fair hand-to-hand combatant, and received coaching from Nighthawk. Nuke suffered from emotional and psychological instability that finally led to insanity.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Nuke appears in the ''[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers Assemble]]'' episode "Avengers' Last Stand," voiced by [[Phil LaMarr]].{{cn|date=July 2015}} He appears as a member of the Squadron Supreme. When the Avengers raid the Squadron Supreme's citadel a third time, they find it is actually draining some energy from Earth's core in order to restore Nuke who then destroys the citadel (though [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Ant-Man]] manages to shrink himself and the other Avengers to safety onto Mjolnir). Nuke then meets up with Nighthawk as he is pleased that the Squadron Supreme is back together. Nuke is present when Nighthawk makes his demands on television. In the episode "Avengers Underground," Iron Man, Thor, and Falcon trap Zarda and Nuke in the same prison box. As part of his contingency plan Nighthawk then teleports Nuke and Hyperion to the tower where Hyperion absorbs Nuke's power with the intent on destroying Earth.

==Other versions==
===Earth-13034===
The Earth-13034 version of Nuke is a member of this reality's version of the Squadron Supreme. He and his fellow Squadron Supreme members were killed when Earth-13034 collided with another reality which left their Hyperion the only survivor that led to him ending up on Earth-616.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 5 #4</ref>
