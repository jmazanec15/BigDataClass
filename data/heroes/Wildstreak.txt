Wildstreak's father was once a [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]] agent, but he resigns when his wife gets pregnant. Unfortunately Wildstreak's mother dies shortly after she was born. She is raised only by her father. Tamika grows up to become an excellent gymnast, where she develops a crush on a boy named Carl Washington. Unfortunately Carl drops out of school and without Tamika knowing it, he became an [[arms dealer]].{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Tamika later focuses on her gymnastics and could win an [[Olympic medal]] for it, were it not for gang member Big John Buscelli. John tries to recruit Tamika for Hydra but she declines. Not accepting no for an answer, John causes an incident which robs her of the use of her legs. During her recovery Tamika decides to develop an [[exoskeleton]] which would once again enable her to walk. Succeeding in this, she decided to use her power for good and become the super-hero known as Wildstreak.{{issue|date=December 2012}}
