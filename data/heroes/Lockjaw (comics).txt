'''Lockjaw''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[bulldog]]-like being appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. With the physical appearance of a giant bulldog, Lockjaw is an [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] dog with the teleportation power (as well as other abilities) who serves the Inhuman Royal Family as their escort and as a loyal protector.

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=December 2012}}
He first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' #45 (December 1965), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==Fictional character biography==
Lockjaw was born on the island of [[Attilan]], formerly in the Atlantic Ocean. Lockjaw resembles a giant bulldog and serves in the capacity of the [[Inhumans]]' teleporter and escort to the Royal Family of the Inhumans. Many times he has brought Inhumans to Earth and back again. At times, his powers have been manipulated by evil forces, most usually by [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus the Mad]].

Lockjaw and the Royal Family encountered [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus]]' creation, the Trikon, and were driven from Attilan's Great Refuge in exile.<ref>''Inhumans Special'' #1</ref>

Lockjaw first appeared as a member of the Inhumans when they attempted to retrieve [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]] from the outside world and take her back to Attilan. This led them into conflict with the [[Fantastic Four]], the first humans they met, who were harboring Medusa after rescuing her from the villainous [[Frightful Four]]. Accordingly, Lockjaw is indirectly responsible for revealing the existence of Attilan to the outside world. They returned to Attilan and became trapped in Maximus' "negative zone" barrier around the Great Refuge.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #45-48</ref>

Lockjaw is able to escape and becomes separated from his city. He roams the country for some time, accidentally terrorizing the local citizens, until he meets up with [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]] and [[Wyatt Wingfoot]]. He journeyed with the pair in their attempt to breach the "negative zone" barrier.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #55-58; ''Fantastic Four Annual'' #4</ref> Before long, the Inhumans were freed from the "negative zone" barrier, and Lockjaw transported [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]] to New York, and brought [[Triton (comics)|Triton]] from Attilan to rescue [[Mister Fantastic]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #61-62</ref> Lockjaw was later compelled to return Crystal to Attilan by Maximus.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #82-83</ref>

With Crystal, Lockjaw was captured by [[Diablo (Marvel Comics)|Diablo]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #117</ref> They later rescued the injured [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]].<ref>''Avengers'' #110</ref> Before long, Lockjaw attended the wedding of Quicksilver and Crystal.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #150</ref> He also brought the Fantastic Four to Attilan to battle Thraxton.<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' #12</ref>

===Seemingly speaking===
At one point, Quicksilver and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] witnessed what appeared to be Lockjaw, apparently a sentient being once mutated by [[Terrigen Mists]], speaking to them. This convinces Quicksilver not to expose his daughter [[Luna (comics)|Luna]] to the Mists.<ref>''The Thing'' #3</ref> However, Lockjaw later brought Quicksilver to Washington, D.C., in search of [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], and Quicksilver there stated that Lockjaw's sentience was actually a hoax perpetrated on the Thing by [[Karnak (comics)|Karnak]] and [[Gorgon (Inhuman)|Gorgon]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #71â€“72</ref>

Lockjaw brought the other Inhumans to Earth in search of Medusa when she fled Attilan to avoid a compulsory abortion. He also transported the injured Triton back to Attilan.<ref>''Marvel Graphic Novel: The Inhumans''</ref> With Crystal, he later summoned the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] to help battle [[Thane Ector]] and the Brethren.<ref>''Avengers'' #334</ref> With the Avengers, he battled the Brethren.<ref>''Avengers'' #336-338</ref>

As noted in ''[[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-Zar]]'' #12, Lockjaw also travels to the [[Heroes Reborn (comics)|Heroes Reborn]] universe with his Inhuman family. This visit lasts for about a year; all are returned successfully.<ref>''Ka-Zar'' #12</ref>

Having always been particularly fond of Ben Grimm, Lockjaw elects to stay with him. Ben, fondly recounting that he "always wanted a dog", accepted. It is not known why Lockjaw did not accompany Ben Grimm when he felt the need to retreat to France during the ''[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]''.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

Lockjaw is featured into the 2006 limited series ''[[Son of M]]''. With the majority of the mutants on Earth having been rendered powerless, [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] decides to steal the [[Inhumans]] mutagenic Terrigen Mists and re-power willing mutants. Lockjaw is convinced to help him on the mission. Traveling with Quicksilver's daughter [[Luna (comics)|Luna]], they traverse the Earth, heading to such places as [[Genosha]]. The other Inhumans follow.<ref>''Son of M'' (2006)</ref>

Later, Lockjaw rejoins Black Bolt, Medusa and other Inhumans in order to assist a super-human strikeforce in taking down the confused [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]].<ref>''New Avengers'' #9</ref>

Lockjaw assists his family tracking down Black Bolt, who had been captured by the Skrulls. Using technology gained from their allies, the Kree, Lockjaw's abilities are upgraded, allowing him to teleport much farther.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Inhumans''</ref>

===New allies===
In 2009, Lockjaw received a four-issue mini-series titled ''[[Lockjaw and the Pet Avengers]]'', teaming with [[Lockheed (comics)|Lockheed]], [[Redwing (Marvel Comics)|Redwing]], Ms. Lion ([[Aunt May]]'s puppy from ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]''), [[Zabu]], [[Robbie Baldwin#Fictional character biography|Niels the Cat/Hairball]], and a new frog named [[List of Thor supporting characters#Other supporting characters|Throg]]. This series involves Lockjaw bringing the [[Infinity Gauntlet]] together with the assistance of animal allies.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/090202-Lockjaw.html | work=[[Newsarama]] | title=Inside Lockjaw and the Pet Avengers | accessdate=2009-03-22}}</ref> The series was well-received enough{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} that there have been two additional mini-series with the Pet Avengers.

Lockjaw re-joins his Inhuman family for the conflicts that eventually led to them taking over the Kree empire. This leads to the seeming loss of Black Bolt despite Crystal and Lockjaw's best efforts.<ref>''War of Kings'' #1-6 (March-Aug. 2009)</ref> This conflict also leads to the ravaging of the Shi'ar Empire. As his family determines who will rule, Lockheed is seen playing closely with Luna and assisting with Shi'ar recovery efforts.<ref>''War of Kings: Who Will Rule?'' One-Shot (Nov. 2009)</ref> Lockjaw again becomes involved with gathering the Infinity Gauntlet together when the Soul Gem is lost and later found.<ref>''New Avengers'' #3 (2013)</ref> Lockjaw was also sent by Medusa to keep an eye on recent Inhuman [[Ms. Marvel (Kamala Khan)]],<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' #7 (2014)</ref> and helps her in her battle against a cockatiel/human hybrid clone of [[Thomas Edison]] known as The Inventor.<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' #8-11 (2014)</ref>

During the ''[[Inhumans vs. X-Men]]'' storyline, Lockjaw was taking a nap when he is knocked out by [[Fantomex]].<ref>''IVX'' #2</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Lockjaw seemingly has "super-canine" strength in his jaw for a dog his age and size. At one time, he locked on to the Thing's arm and the Thing could not get him to let go. Lockjaw can also teleport himself, and nearby living creatures and matter to anywhere he wants, from the Earth to the Moon, and can even open passages between dimensions. Energy barriers that are seemingly impenetrable to others seem to pose no problem to him. Lockjaw also has the ability to psionically trace a given "scent" across dimensional space.

Lockjaw also once seemingly sensed danger from far off, when [[Doctor Doom]] had manipulated [[Silver Surfer]]'s powers.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

Lockjaw is capable of chewing and swallowing inorganic material, such as scraps of sophisticated robots, with no ill effect. It is not known if this is his primary source of nourishment.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

In the ''[[Secret Invasion]]: Inhumans'' mini-series, the Royal Family enter into an alliance with the [[Kree]] to free [[Black Bolt]] from his [[Skrull]] captors. To that end, the Kree greatly enhance Lockjaw's teleportation powers, enabling him to teleport himself and others over vast interplanetary distances.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Inhumans'' #3</ref>

==Other versions==

===Earth X===
In the alternate future of [[Earth X]], Lockjaw is shot by some gaseous bullet and murdered by [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus]]. His teleportation-forehead assembly is seemingly the only part of him that has survived. It is used by Black Bolt and the other Inhumans to investigate happenings on Earth.

===Marvel Knights 2099===
Lockjaw is one of the few Royal family members to survive to the year 2099; Maximus the Mad had slain the rest. The Inhumans had established themselves on a space station also called Attilan.<ref>''Marvel Knights 2099'' (2004)</ref>

===Marvel Zombies===
Lockjaw appears zombified along with the Royal Family of the Inhumans, creating a portal for them to meet with the Kingpin.<ref>''Marvel Zombies 3'' #2</ref> He is later seen trying to attack [[Machine Man]]. The heroic android tricks Lockjaw into teleporting to the mainstream Marvel Universe. Lockjaw is tricked into eating an explosive-laden human brain. He is destroyed in the explosion.<ref>''Marvel Zombies 3'' #4</ref> Another Lockjaw is seen when the zombie virus spreads to "Earth Z". He too is zombiefied and assists in slaying the "[[Warbound]]". He was captured by Machine Man, Ultron and Jocasta.<ref>''Marvel Zombies Return'' #4 (2009)</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
Lockjaw also appears in ''Ultimate Fantastic Four Annual'' #1. In this incarnation, he has teleportation powers as well. He leaves the Inhumans' Himalayan refuge with Crystal, who is running away because she was being forced to marry Black Bolt's brother, Maximus (only Crystal suspects he is mad). Lockjaw assists in saving Crystal from her pursuing guards but they eventually drag her back home anyway. They leave him behind and he brings the Fantastic Four for assistance. This is not well received as most of Inhuman society severely dislikes any outsiders. Black Bolt ends up destroying the evacuated Attilan simply because the Four "contaminated" it. Several of the Inhumans indicate they had conspired for Lockjaw to be left behind in the human world.<ref>''Ultimate Fantastic Four Annual'' #1 (2005)</ref>

===Video games===
* Lockjaw appears as a non-playable hero in the video game ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]''.{{cn|date=December 2017}} His duty was to send the heroes to the [[Shi'ar]] galaxy and [[Skrull]] homeworld to gather implements necessary to defeating a divinely-empowered [[Doctor Doom]]. Also though not there in appearance, the game implies that the mini-portals used in the game for midpoint to home-base transport are made by Lockjaw since every time the player tries to create a portal outside the circumstances when that is possible, the message "Lockjaw cannot create a portal in that area" appears. This creates somewhat of a continuity error since when the player gains that ability, it is attributed to an experimental teleportation device created by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] He also has special "conversations" with [[Spider-Man]], [[Deadpool]], and [[Thing (comics)|Thing]].
* Lockjaw appears as a non-playable character in ''[[Marvel: Contest of Champions]]'' that only appears on the Gifting Badge and in ''Have You Seen This Dog?'' dialogue.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

===Non-fiction===
* The debate over Lockjaw's sentience is discussed in Peter David's non-fiction book ''Writing For Comics''. In this, he discussed how he tried to go with Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's original assertion that Lockjaw was a 'dumb animal'.<ref>{{Cite book|title= Writing for Comics|last= David|first= Peter|year= 2006|publisher= Impact|ISBN= 9781581807301 |page=112}}</ref> He appears in a discussion of Marvel comics in a reprinted segment of a ''Casey At The Bat'' parody in ''The Penguin Book of Comics''.
