Velocidad  ('''Gabriel Cohuelo''') is a [[fictional]] [[comic book]] superhero appearing in books published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #527, in the second chapter of the "Five Lights" storyline, and was created by [[Matt Fraction]] and [[Kieron Gillen]].<ref>http://www.newsarama.com/comics/kieron-gillen-introduces-generation-hope-101103.html</ref> He is one of the "Five Lights"â€”a group of mutants who manifested their abilities after the events of "[[X-Men: Second Coming|Second Coming]]".

==Publication history==
Velocidad first appeared in ''Uncanny X-Men'' as a teenager whose mutation is out of control. Following his introduction, he, along with [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]], [[Transonic (comics)|Transonic]], [[Oya (comics)|Oya]], [[Kenji Uedo|Zero]], and [[Primal (comics)|Primal]], began to feature in the series [[Generation Hope (comics)|Generation Hope]].<ref name=GH1>''Generation Hope'' #1 (2011)</ref>  He continues to make appearances in ''Uncanny X-Men'' as well.

He has shown a romantic interest in Hope, flirting with her upon meeting and kissing her upon arrival at [[Asteroid_M#Fifth_version.2FUtopia|Utopia]].<ref name=GH4>''Generation Hope'' #4 (2011)</ref> By the events of ''Schism,'' the pair had gone on at least one date before breaking up.

==Fictional character biography==
===The Second Light===
Gabriel is a 16-year-old mutant from Mexico City.  When his powers manifest, he loses control; his thoughts race and his body begins to move so quickly that he can no longer be seen with the naked eye.  Fearing for his safety, [[Cecilia Reyes]] and [[Psylocke]] restrain him with Cecilia's force field until [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]] arrives to stabilize his powers.<ref name=UXM527>''Uncanny X-Men'' #527 (2010)</ref>

After this incident, Gabriel decides to follow Hope on her mission to retrieve the remaining Lights.  Eventually, after recruiting [[Oya (comics)|Oya]] and [[Primal (comics)|Primal]], the group travels to Japan, and Gabriel participates in his first mission - subduing the mutant [[Kenji Uedo|Kenji Uedo/Zero]]. Kenji lost control of his bio-mechanical powers, and has started destroying Tokyo.  In the course of the fight, Gabriel is excited that he is now teammates with X-Men like Wolverine and Cyclops, but worries about the danger he's put himself into.<ref name=GH1/> Gabriel is eventually key to taking Zero down, as he rushes Hope close enough to Zero to mimic his powers, while also helping ensure the other Lights are not injured. 

After successfully subduing Zero, he follows Hope to Utopia, eventually relocating with the rest of the Lights.<ref name="GH4"/>  Like the rest of the student-aged population, Gabriel takes classes taught by more experienced X-Men.<ref name=GH5>''Generation Hope'' #5 (2011)</ref>  However, like all the other Lights, he is more concerned with training Hope provides than the classes taught by the X-Men, so much so that he followed Hope after she stormed out of an ethics class being taught by [[Emma Frost]].

When a Sixth Light was located in [[Germany]], Gabriel, Hope, and the other Lights went to pick it up. When they arrived, Gabriel went to do a quick recon of the hospital the Light was located in, but he was quickly knocked unconscious. Deducing that the Light was a telepath, Kenji offered to share his limited protection against telepathy with the group, including Gabriel. Inside the hospital, the Lights discovered that the Sixth Light was actually an infant who was scared to be born. They were able to convince it to embrace life, and Hope suppressed it's X-Gene with a touch until it was older. 

Later, Hope decided that the Lights needed their own codenames. Gabriel quickly shouts out "''Velocidad''" (the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word for ''speed'') and claims the name as his own. He also had a hand in coming up with several of the other's codenames, driving most of the conversation about them, a tactic Gillen says he liked to use as Gabriel was a natural at driving conversations.<ref>http://gillen.cream.org/wordpress_html/2220/on-leaving-generation-hope/</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Divine Empowerment Gabriel was given his powers by Mercury. Jimmy once claimed it was Apollo. 

Speed Force Conduit: Gabriel's powers come from a connection to the Speed Force, gained when Mercury gived him his powers. People who, for whatever reason, are connected to the Speed Force are sometimes called Speed Force Conduits. This means that they are connected to the Speed Force and are tethered to it.After 10000 age in the Speed Force, in his perspective all his capacities developed to exceedingly potent level, well-surpassing all other known speedsters; with only the Reverse-Flash being able to match him.

Speed Physiology: Gabriel's body is adapted towards the rigors of high-speed running. His cardiovascular and respiratory systems are many times more efficient than those of a normal human being. He metabolizes an estimated 95% of the caloric energy content of foodstuffs (normal humans use about 25%). The chemical processes of Gabriel's musculature are so highly enhanced that his body does not generate fatigue poisons, the normal by-products of locomotion, which force the body to rest. Rather, his body constantly expels waste products during his accelerated respiration through exhalation. His joints are smoother and lubricated more efficiently than those of a normal human being. His tendons have the tensile strength of spring steel. His bones contain unknown materials significantly more durable than calcium to withstand the dynamic shocks of his feet touching the ground at speeds a human could never achieve or withstand. Gabriel's practical reaction time is several times faster than a normal human's and the speed at which his brain processes information is heightened to a level commensurate with his bodily speed, enabling him to perceive his surroundings while traveling at high velocities. Gabriel's lachrymose is more viscous than normal, thus preventing rapid evaporation and replenishment of surface fluids on his eyeballs under the influence of high wind velocity to occlude his vision.He has shown various physical enhancements, due to the effects of his power. In fact, kinetic energy, inertia, friction, pressure, and vectors have no effect on him. Gabriel's unique biology causes his body to produce massive amounts of electricity, which charges his molecules to allow for his accelerated movements.

Super Speed

After being granted his power by Mercury, in the 25th century Gabriel was gifted with the ability to run at vast superhuman speeds.While running, he can only be perceived as a blur.[2] He is fast enough to easily outpace Superman,[41] and was fast enough to repair an entire city without anyone realizing he ever left the room. He's so fast in fact time seems to slow down around him, making him appear to be effectively invisible to others within their relative time frame.His speed allows him to move faster than a normal human mind can even perceiveas well as break any dimensional barrier and even enter the Speed Force itself,with esse. His speed is so immense that seconds after the initial explosion of the X-Mansion, he was able to effectively save the dozens of inhabitants inside, all while goofing off, before the explosion reached peak combustion.Gabriel has used his powers of acceleration for various feats. He has plucked an arrow out of the air from a standing start, running around the world faster than Brainiac could think and has dodged machine gun fire. He has created cyclone-like gusts of wind, which are able to knock a man off his feet. He is able to run across the Atlantic Ocean and to oversea continents without having to stop, run up the sides of buildings effortlessly,his running speed was increased until he was capable of easily reaching high supersonic speeds between Mach 4 (3,080 miles per hour) and Mach 5 (3,691, miles per hour).[41] The true extent of his amplified abilities are unknown and are stated to be limitless, he has been observed outrunning Thor's lightning bolts, running from Tibet to Indonesia in a few seconds, and covering half the Earth's distance in 92 seconds (not at full speed). He has ran back and forth in time and created time displaced duplicates (which Stephen Hawking theorized to take speeds of 25,000,000 mph) it can be confirmed Gabriel has moved at speeds faster than light.Theoretically, his speed greater than Mach 10, are dangerous to both the people and to the environment. This speed would still be the equivalent to approximately 2 miles per second, allowing him to cross the United States in about 23 seconds , or circle the world in about 3 seconds, but the Speed Force has shown that if needed, Gabriel can use it to prevent such effects from occurring, hence why he is able to run at speeds much faster than light on the planet Earth without it having devastating effects on the planet. Gabriel has shown that he can achieve practically any speed he wishes and that there are no limits to his speed. He has been able to casually move beyond the speed of thought, easily move so fast that even an attack moving at the speed of light seems to be standing still and at the same time scans the face of over five hundred thousand people for a specific expression in less than a picosecond.[citation needed] He is able to easily save and carry over half a million people 35 miles away from a Nuclear Warhead that had already detonated including the ones at ground zero in only .0001 microseconds (10 picoseconds, or 1/100,000,000,000th of 1 second) - a feat that would require moving 13 trillion times the speed of light[60][61] - and even move so fast that he exists everywhere at once.[citation needed] He is able to casually reach speeds such as 500 times the speed of light.[citation needed] He has moved and ran so fast, that he was capable of outrunning and defeating death itself (the Black Flash) by outracing it to the end of time/space, past entropy, the next Big Bang and into the next Universe. Gabriel is also immune to the effects of friction, reduced oxygen up to a point where a human can no longer breathe, and impact upon his body while moving at super-speeds. He has traveled around the world by running on top of the ocean water and even ran all the way up Mount Everest without slowing down and went flying above cloud level as a result. He has recently shown the ability to shift his molecules through solid objects, and transport people at speeds greater than the speed of sound without injuring them.His speed is so immeasurable that he has moved and reacted by the attosecond (an attosecond is one quintillionth of a second. To put this in perspective, one attosecond is to one second, what one second is to the age of the universe),and has even reacted and calculated by the zeptosecond (Which is one sextillionth of one second). Gabriel notably ran away from a fridge, knocked out a pharmacy mugger, and ran back to the fridge (all so quickly, that the milk bottle left by him in the air was still in the exact same place, not having enough time to fall), and drew on a man's face without him even noticing. Gabriel easily dodged a Parademon's plasma bolts, and then promptly proceeded to run behind the latter's back and send the Parademon flying (all before it could even react) he can complete his various daily activities in seconds, and even casual walking can go unnoticed by normal people. 

Accelerated Perception - As a result of his super speed, Gabriel tends to see the world around him as if it were moving in slow motion. Even fired bullets seem frozen in midair from his perspective.This heightened alertness enables him to instantly read and adapt to the situation. His perception of time, however, seems to vary by his emotional state, as in one instance, when he was waiting to check out from work, he described it as feeling as if it were hours away, while in real time it was merely minutes.

Speed â€‹â€‹Mind: Gabriel has the ability to evaluate and predict the innumerable possible and probable results of most situations by playing advanced variables tests inside his head. He can simulate a rapid pre-game sequence of several causes, effects and inevitable results at an accelerated rate. [15] Gabriel's speeding mind also allowed him to learn instantly to operate a Green Lantern ring. Even while using his brute speed, he can think clearly, react to events, and perform actions until normal humans can perceive them. This allows him to learn in a small fraction of normal time, able to read and familiarize himself with Earth-Two Science within seconds. Although most of the speedsters eventually forget information they get quickly, Gabriel does not. He can also create wind funnels and is able to talk incredibly fast and detect things that move too fast for the normal human being to observe.simple computations can be done at lightning speeds, and his ability to perform normal feats at increased speeds has allowed to build hundreds of force field generators in a matter of minutes, move sandbags to cover a beach or search for an area for something small as a paper clip. Gabriel can also read at super-speed,Because Gabriel has a high speed of perception, telepaths often have difficulty using their abilities against him.

Super Reflexes: 

Gabriel's speed extends to his reflexes as well, even if he is not moving at super speed, as he managed to easily dodge a batarang thrown at him by Bruce Wayne, with it appearing to be moving at him in slow motion (at least 62 times slower than in reality)[11], and Bruce himself frozen in place from Gabriel's perspective. While in this state, he was shown to still able to outpace not only moving objects, but the speed of other forces, such as gravity, allowing him to move faster than an object can be affected by gravity and begin falling, as he did when stopping a mugger while leaving a milk jug in the air for him to return to and grab before it started falling. His reflexes are faster than normal people can even perceive. Indeed, even the contrarily fast Wonder Woman and Aquaman appear to move in slow motion from Gabriel's perspective; however, Superman is shown to be capable of moving at similar speed, as he was able to match Gabriel himself on one occasion. everything he perceives, moves slower to him. His great reflexes have allowed him to perform feats such as dodging lightnings andÂ  a close range optic blast from Cyclops.

Accelerated Metabolism

Gabriel's powers also accelerates his metabolic rate. His body can break down food more efficiently than a regular human and, as a result, expels very little waste products that he can exhale through his skin. This enables him to rapidly heal from injuries much quicker than a normal human. After being severely injured by Apocalypse, Gabriel is seen with crutches, however he made a full recovery after a day. Gabriel required only a few minutes to heal from getting shot in the leg by a Parademon plasma bolt. However, because of his body's ability function at an accelerated speed, he burns calories at an accelerated rate, keeping his body slim and fit. Due to this, Gabriel needs to intake a superhumanly high amount of calories (typically in the form of whatever food he can find) in order to function normally, leading Gabriel to describe himself as a "foodhole": a black hole of food. most damage heals in hours if not minutes with no lingering signs. Even normally permanent damage, like paraplegia, is completely repaired in days. His body can break down food more efficiently than a regular human and, as a result, expels very little waste products that he can exhale through his skin. He recovers from in seconds if not is immune to any illness or contaminant. 2,000 milligrams of horse tranquilizer only momentarily slowed down until his body burned through it. 

Electrokinesis: Gabriel's body generates large amounts of electrical energy that he draws from the Speed Force. This Speed Force lightning emanates off of him, especially when he moves at super-speed. When angered, Gabriel's body will supercharge with large amounts of electricity.[19] Gabriel can also enhance his strikes with his lightning.[20] The color of his lightning was originally yellow, although after escaping the Speed Force, the color of his lightning turned white, due to his connection to the Speed Force growing stronger after being adrift within it for so can also be used in many other ways. The intensity of it can interfere with the surrounding electronics and overwhelm electric-absorption, as seen from Blackout. He can focus the energy into specific body parts to produce a strong static shock on contact with the target.Gabriel can harness this electricity to repeatedly hurl lightning to stun or repel enemies, and also electrify a surface.and can cause electronic technology nearby to short-circuit, overload, or even burst into sparks. Gabriel can also harness this lightning as projectiles to varying effects, as he's capable of utilizing incredibly powerful bolts, notably sending an incredible bolt a Mother Box to assist in resurrecting Superman. Gabriel can also charge the air vortexes that he generates with Speed Force electricity, thereby further increasing their offensive capabilities.[6] He is also capable of using this ability for smaller tasks, as he lit a small firecracker by snapping his fingers Gabriel is also capable of making his eyes glow bright white. 

Bodily vibration/Intangibility: Gabriel can vibrate his body for various effects. This can mask his form from being clearly perceived or distort his vocal cords to disguise his voice. His vibrations can forcibly expel any toxins in him. He can also generate enough heat to recover and stay thermally insulated from extreme cold. Offensively, he can vibrate his limbs to seamlessly grind through highly solid targets, which he can use to harm or kill a person, as he was tempted to do to Zoom and the Reverse-Flash. Also by vibrating his molecules at the frequency of air, Gabriel can physically pass through solid matter, even highly complex matter like carbine while in a universe of a different vibrational nature. He do this with multiple targets, saving an entire moving train and hundreds of passengers. He can also harmlessly pass through living individuals as he did to escape Atom Smasher's grasp. Alternatively, he can use this as a weapon by passing his punch through a person's body, incapacitating them as he did against Solovar. During his final fight against Savitar, Gabriel's efficiency could simultaneously shift the time remnant out of his armor and encase himself in it.When done, this is seen as a haze that normal people can't perceive clearly. It can also garble his voice into a deep growl to disguise.This ability appears to have damaging effects on electrical equipment, as it shorted out Mason's computer. By vibrating rapidly, Gabriel was able to reverse his modified appearance-stealing cord's effects.

Geokinesis: By vibrating at varying frequencies and with different levels of force, Gabriel can create small tremors to induce extreme amounts of jolt on any target he touches, even disrupt the inter-molecular bonds and cause it to shatter. This can lead to many effects such as molecular combustion upon physical contact with the target. His vibrations can even shatter targets into fragments, as he did to Savitar's armor once inside it.to disrupt the inter-molecular bonds around him. This can lead to many effects such as molecular combustion upon physical contact with the target.

Superhuman Agility: His physiology grants him superhuman agility being more flexible and having greater balance.Gabriel was able to jump up high into the air without any build-up or change in speed and balance. He could easily run around his basement in a blink of an eye despite the number of stolen objects and the three X-men members coming in later. During the evacuation of the mansion, Gabriel is capable of performing a back flip whilst carrying two students under his arms.

Super Stamina: Despite Gabriel's super-humanly accelerated metabolism, his highly developed stamina prevents him from tiring or building up lactic acid or fatigue toxins.Gabriel possesses immense superhuman stamina, which allows him to withstand the stress of moving at high speeds for extended periods of time without growing tired or weak. Gabriel's physiology grants him greater stamina when compared to an ordinary human, allowing him to operate at peak capacity for at least several hours before he begins to grow tired. Gabriel can handle the stresses of extreme racing without noticeable distress, letting him function much longer than normal humans unhindered. His enhanced stamina is due to his augmented physiology, which builds up little to no lactic acid or fatigue toxins. Even after running from coast to coast of the country to pick up a pizza, Gabriel remained unfazed from the prolonged running.

Decelerated Aging - It is likely that his health and longevity are also extended. According to Wolverine, he and Gabriel met sometime after 2006, stating that Gabriel can get into anywhere. This implies that Gabriel ages at a slower rate and likewise has not lost any speed despite being around 67 years old.in a potential future of 2024, Gabriel looked exactly the same as when first became the Scarlat Flash.

Cosmic Awareness: After escaping the Speed Force, Gabriel was able to feel a presence from another dimension watching over the Prime Earth.

Superhuman Strength: Gabriel possesses superhuman strength in his lower body as part of his body's adaptations for running. With his upper body he can lift (press) approximately 1000 pounds while his legs can press approximately 1 ton under optimal conditions.

Punch de massa infinita: Viajar perto da velocidade da luz adquiriu a massa relativÃ­stica dessa velocidade para transmitir golpes que poderiam atingir com uma forÃ§a maior que a de "uma estrela anÃ£ branca e a massa do corpo aumentarÃ¡ em direÃ§Ã£o ao infinito. gerar tremendo, capaz de derrubar uma pessoa. Ele pode impulsionar-se para saltar alturas e distÃ¢ncias tremendas. Ele tambÃ©m pode criar forÃ§a de fricÃ§Ã£o substancial com qualquer objeto que ele toca, e exercer forÃ§a suficiente para lanÃ§ar pessoas no ar. Isso parece negar o O peso do seu alvo, o poder de se mover como se os alvos fossem congelados, mesmo nÃ£o meio do ar. AlÃ©m disso, vocÃª pode propelir e manipular o caminho do vÃ´o dos Ã¡lbuns, incluindo o bala lanÃ§ado sem perda de forÃ§a e lanÃ§ar-a travÃ©s da uma barreira poderosa, por uma pessoa. Ele pode remover completamente uma forÃ§a fÃ­sica de ondas de marÃ© maciÃ§as, estabilizar uma singularidade gigante ou dissipar os furacÃµes F3 correndo Ao redor deles. Ele tambÃ©m pode encaixar os dedos para inflamar o gÃ¡s inflamÃ¡vel com uma fricÃ§Ã£o. Gabriel pode gerar forÃ§a suficiente para quebrar a durabilidade natural de um alvo, pois ele, sem esforÃ§o, destruiu seu caminho para fora de sua cÃ©lula meta-humana.

Momentum Negation: Gabriel also has the ability to come to a full stop despite the extreme momentum of his motion, with Gabriel notably not breaking a milk bottle after running back and catching it in mid-air at super speed. This allows him to further the illusion of having not moved at all if he travels at super speed and then returns to the exact location he started at before anyone can perceive it[5]. Thus, Gabriel also avoids breaking anything while speedily exploring the Batcave.

Aerokinesis: Gabriel can use his speed to generate air flows on various levels and for various effects. He can create vortexes to suffocate people or extinguish fires by forming it around them. He can create large and strong tornadoes, able to repel massive targets. Alternatively, he can use this skill to propel himself through the air as a pseudo-form of flying.

Navigation: Gabriel can sense vibrational patterns in his environment that enable him to always find magnetic north. This allows him to navigate and change course instinctively despite blurring at high speeds or lack of landmarks, like over open ocean.

Speed Lend/Steal: Gabriel is able to lend or steal speed and/or momentum from anyone or anything, including beings such as Superman or Inertia effectively turning them into living statues. Also can steal speed from bullets and other fast moving objects thrown at him or at others. This ability is so great, that he once took the speed from the entire planet, and its population, including the very fast beings such as Superman, Jay Garrick etc. He cannot, however, steal speed from certain speedsters such as Professor Zoom, who creates his own negative Speed Force and is able to corrupt/negate the Speed Force, 

Sharing the Force: "Lending" Speed â€‹â€‹for objects or people already on the move. From your interaction with Speed â€‹â€‹Force, you can also create your speed and angular momentum to another object or person. This may allow others to run alongside Gabriel.

Speed Force Empathy: Gabriel can sense when another Speed Force conduit is troubled, and can be drawn to the location of that speedster.

Electromagnetism: Due to his electrical generation, Gabriel possesses some level of magnetic manipulation, which he uses to control his suit's armor. Every time Barry releases his suit from his ring, the metal pieces of it are conducted by his lightning to form the suit around him.[1] He can also mentally manipulate the metal pieces that form his mask and cause them to unravel, unmasking himself.[47] Barry can also use his lightning to create electromagnetic fields.[48]

Speed Force Aura: The Flash's body is surrounded by what he calls his "Speed Force aura". This aura protects him and anyone who is running with him or carried by him, from the effects of using his speed. This includes friction and airborne particulate matter. 

Shock Wave Projection: Gabriel possess the ability to create very powerful sonic booms and shock waves with just the clap of his hands.

Speed mirages: By using his speed to bounce back and forth so quickly, Gabriel can create after-images with his speed, making it appear like he's in two places at once. This image is so realistic, human mind can't perceive the difference.

Speed Strike - In addition, his super speed causes the weight and hardness of objects and people being nonexistent to him while he moves at super speed, able to generate tremendous force with seemingly little exertion and throw people through the air. A simple tap on the cheek at superhuman speed was enough to send a fully grown man flying and knocking him out.

Paradoxical Existence: Gabriel was transformed into a living paradox when Barry Allen created the Flashpoint timeline, as he was running through the timestream when this happened.[22] This makes Gabriel immune to alterations to his personal timeline, making him the sole constant in any timeline. It is also impossible to erase him from existence.

Time Acceleration: During one of his battles with Zoom, Gabriel realized that his powers are also connected to the flow of time and that he can move it forward, which allows Gabriel to speed up time. By speeding up time, Gabriel was able to negate Zoom's power to slow time. While speeding up time, Gabriel's lightning turns white.

Invisibility: Gabriel can vibrate his body so fast that that he can no longer be perceived by the human eye. When Gabriel was trapped in a barrier prison that prevented phasing, Gabriel did this in order to "trick" Clifford DeVoe into releasing him.

Time alterations immunity: Even if Gabriel is not responsible for the time alterations, he can still remain somewhat unaffected by it; as he remembers that John Diggle and Lyla Michaels had a daughter instead of a son in the original timeline.

Time remnant construct: , By leaping only mere seconds in time Gabriel is able to "create an indefinite number of "temporal dupes" . As each one is as real as the other, that could be controlled with a certain amount of coordination. it allows Gabriel to overwhelm his enemies with multiple copies of himself.

Speed Force Visions: In certain cases, Gabriel receives visions from the Speed Force when something is not right, such as the first time the Harryson Wells's met each other. Sometimes these visions give Gabriel headaches and in some cases pull him into the Speed Force, which forced both Wells's to pull him out.

Time travel:Using the Speed Force, speedsters such as the Gabriel are able to conduct chronokinesis, or temporal manipulation, which allows him to travel throughout time. Unlike users of the Speed Force, Gabriel's ability to travel through and manipulate time is more refined compared to other speedsters as he is easily able to drastically alter history and completely erase people from existence Unlike other speedsters, Gabriel's reality alterations have no side-effects. This ability has also allowed Gabriel to continue existing despite being erased from existence on two separate occasions. Martin Stein theorized that the only reason Gabriel was still able to exist within the timeline is because the Speed Force protected him throughout multiple points in history where he has traveled. In order to time travel to different periods, he must exceed light speed, which he can easily and instantly do.

Interdimensional Journey: Gabriel can move fast enough to open open portals between dimensions, allowing him to travel to different universes. If you wish, Gabriel can also bring others with him as he did with Harry and Cisco to Terra Two. While originally he could not consciously control this, as his first solo use was made by accident and needed assistance to return home, after considerably increasing his Speed â€‹â€‹Force connection, he can open portals opened by himself and consciously choose his destination, even in the force of the speed itself. spreading a message of warning across the Multiverse he managed to gain the aid of the Flashes of the Multiverse to defeat and disinfect Nix Uotan.

==Other versions==
===Age of X===
Gabriel appears briefly with [[Angel Salvadore]] and [[Dazzler]] in the ''[[Age of X]]'' storyline. The trio are hunted through the sewers before being transported to Fortress X by [[Doctor Strange]]. Like his main-universe counterpart, this version of Gabriel has a marked enthusiasm for the codename "Velocidad".<ref>''Age of X: Universe'' #2 (2011)</ref>
