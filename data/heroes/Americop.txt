'''Americop''' ('''Bartholomew Gallows''') is a [[fictional]] [[vigilante]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
{{expand-section|date=March 2017}}
Americop first appeared in ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' (1st series) #428 (June 1994), and was created by [[Mark Gruenwald]] and [[Dave Hoover]].

==Fictional character biography==
Bart Gallows was born in [[Sugar Land]], [[Texas]]<ref>Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol.1</ref> and later became a [[police officer]] in [[Houston, Texas]]. Disillusioned at the law's inability to protect society from crime, he resigned from the force and became a vigilante named 'Americop'.<ref>''Captain America'' (1st series) #428</ref>

He travels across America and uses a police scanner to track down criminals. He is not above executing the criminals he thinks deserve it. He sometimes takes money from the drug-trafficking criminals he battles. When he does so, he keeps half and donates the rest to drug rehabilitation programs. Americop finds himself in conflict with [[Captain America]] while trying to bring down a child exploitation ring. Captain America is appalled by his brutality.<ref>''Captain America'' (1st series) #429</ref>

Americop's investigation led him to the [[New Orleans]] mansion of indestructible munitions magnate '''[[Damon Dran]]'''. Although initially subdued by a gas grenade attack and imprisoned alongside Captain America, he manages to break free. During the fight he kills several of Dran's mercenaries. During the resulting fight, he shoots down Dran's helicopter. Americop believes Dran died during the crash when the criminal in fact survived.<ref>''Captain America'' (1st series) #430</ref>

===Civil War/Initiative===
After the super-hero [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] and Captain America's death, Americop became a target on the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts']] "Most Wanted" list.

[[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] sends [[Robbie Baldwin|Penance]] and [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] to battle Americop, with the secret hope the vigilante will kill them both, as they have not been worth the trouble. Instead, they crash the vigilante's truck and Bullseye causes Penance to unleash his stored-up energy. This fries 80 percent of Americop's synaptic nerve endings.<ref>''Thunderbolts: Desperate Measures''</ref>

===Captain America: Sam Wilson===
Americop later died, presumably from his injuries, and had his uniform and code name copied by the Americops, a [[Private security company|private security force]] run by Keane Industries.<ref> {{Cite comic|writer = Nick Spencer|penciller = Daniel Acuña|inker = Daniel Acuña|colorist = Daniel Acuña|letterer = VC's Joe Caramagna|editor = Tom Brevoort|title = Captain America: Sam Wilson|volume = 1|issue = #12|date = 17 August 2016|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} </ref>

==Powers and abilities==
*A formidable martial artist and strategist, Americop carries [[.45 caliber pistol]]s, a baton and a fixed blade tactical [[knife]]  
*He wears bulletproof [[Kevlar]] body armor, a ballistic facemask and a customized cap which doubles as a throwing weapon. His costume includes a device that absorbs ambient electrical energy and uses it to increase his strength to low-superhuman levels.<ref>''All New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe HC'' #1</ref> 
*His [[pickup truck]] has a roof-mounted lightbar, police [[Siren (noisemaker)|siren]], [[public address system]] and [[bulletproof]] armor and windows.
