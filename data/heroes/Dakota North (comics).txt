==Fictional character biography== 
Dakota North is the daughter of Samuel J. North, a retired agent of the [[CIA]].<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #117 (September 2008)</ref>  Little is known about Dakota North's early life, other than after she retired from successful modeling career she chose a career as a freelance [[private investigator]].  At the height of its success, Dakota North Investigations had branch offices in New York, Paris, Rome, and Tokyo.

Her earliest recorded case involved being hired by famous fashion designer Luke Jacobson to guard both him and his newest designs.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Dakota North Vol.1 #1|last=|first=|publisher=Marvel Comics|year=1986|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> This case was the first time she butted heads with her rival Carolina South.

Her next case, which she took at the request of her father for his old friend, Major George C. Cooper, required her to guard a deadly sample of an experimental gas.  However the gas, stored in a gold pen, ended up in the possession of Dakota's brother, who had been led to Europe by a spy. Dakota followed Ricky to Switzerland where she and her brother were captured by Sheik Ibn Bheik.  They managed to escape, however the gas sample was released, killing the Sheik and all of his men.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Dakota was next hired by a coalition of modeling firms to track down a serial killer dubbed the Slasher, who had been murdering fashion models with a straight razor.  This led to Dakota guarding fashion models Elyse Nelson and [[Mary Jane Watson]]. During her guard Dakota met [[Spider-Man]] and the two cracked the case, learning that Ms. Nelson is the Slasher and saving Mary Jane's life.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Web of Spider-man (vol.1) #37|last=|first=|publisher=Marvel Comics|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>

She was next hired by [[Jack Power]] (who at the time was Counterweight) to clear children's author Jessie Wilcox Jones of theft charges.  While investigating, Dakota met the [[Punisher]], who had been contacted by Jack's sister, [[Katie Power|Katie]] (Starstreak). Working with the other heroes, Jones' innocence was eventually proven.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Power Pack (vol. 1) #46|last=|first=|publisher=Marvel Comics|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>

Some time later, during a day of shopping, Dakota became involved in a battle between the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] and King-Size, an Inhuman [[Shapeshifting|shape-shifter]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Marvel Super-Heroes (vol. 2) #3|last=|first=|publisher=Marvel Comics|year=1990|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>

Her next case led her to Chicago where she was hired to gather information on the recently relocated [[Luke Cage]].  She ultimately befriended Cage, helping him with a situation involving his father and brother, before she returned to New York.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cage (vol. 1) # 1-4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 19-20|last=|first=|publisher=Marvel Comics|year=1992â€“1993|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>

During the time when Malice, the former [[Dora Milaje]] once known as Nakia, sought to kill all those dear to the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], Dakota was hired by the Panther to safeguard Monica Lynne.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Black Panther (vol. 3) #31-33|last=|first=|publisher=Marvel Comics|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>

Dakota was later hired by the law firm [[Foggy Nelson|Nelson]] & [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Murdock]] as an investigator and bodyguard. She was recommended to Foggy Nelson by her friend [[Jessica Jones]], who previously held the position but has had to relinquish it due to her responsibilities as a new mother.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Daredevil Vol. 2 #82|last=|first=|publisher=Marvel Comics|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>  At one point while in his employ, she was shot and hospitalized.  Her father Samuel became involved in the case and helped resolve it.<ref>''Daredevil'' Vol. 2 #106-110</ref>

Following the incapacitation of Murdock's wife, [[Milla Donovan]], Dakota became closer to him.  Eventually, this led to them having a brief affair, which they both immediately regretted.<ref>''Daredevil'' Vol.2 #111-112''</ref>

Dakota was later stripped of her private investigator's license as part of the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]'s plot to frame the H.A.M.M.E.R. director [[Norman Osborn]] for going after Daredevil's friends to manipulate Matt Murdock to take further action against Osborn as well as further criminalizing his actions with [[Hand (comics)|The Hand]].
