==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=May 2009}}
Created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Dave Cockrum]], Mentor first appeared in ''[Uncanny] X-Men'' #107–109 (October 1977 – February 1978) as a member of the [[Shi'ar]] [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Imperial Guard]].

The character subsequently appears in ''The [[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #157 (May 1982), ''[[Rom (comics)|ROM]] Annual'' #4 (1985), ''X-Men: Spotlight on Starjammers'' #2 (June 1990), ''Uncanny X-Men'' #275 (April 1991), ''[[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]]'' #32 (March 1992), ''Imperial Guard'' #1–3 (January–March 1997), ''[[Inhumans]]'' Vol. 4 #4 (September 2000), ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'' #1 (September 2003), ''Uncanny X-Men'' #477 (October 2006), #479–480 (December 2006 – January 2007), #485-486 (June–July 2007), and ''[[X-Men: Emperor Vulcan]]'' #4–5 (February–March 2008).

He is also involved in the ''[[War of Kings]]'' storyline and the writers [[Dan Abnett]] and [[Andy Lanning]] have described their take on the character: "We want to show Mentor as being terrifyingly able, and one of the most dangerous and capable members of the Imperial Guard. His astonishing brainpower is enhanced (in military terms) by sheer, analytical ruthlessness".<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=20329 ALL THE KINGS' MEN: The Knights], [[Comic Book Resources]], March 5, 2009</ref>

Mentor appeared as part of the "Imperial Guard" entry in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition]]'' #6.

==Fictional character biography==
Mentor is a long-time member of the [[Shi'ar]] [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Imperial Guard]], an army of powerful beings that enforce Shi'ar Imperial law on all planets within the Shi'ar Galaxy and serve the rulers of the Shi'ar Empire. Mentor was among the first of the Imperial Guard to clash with the [[X-Men]] and [[Starjammers]] as they fought to free Shi'ar Empress [[Lilandra Neramani]] from her brother, [[D'Ken]] and [[Erik the Red (comics)|Davan Shakari]].{{Issue|date=May 2009}} Mentor swore his allegiance to Lilandra after D'Ken's defeat.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

Unlike many of his fellow guardsmen, he remained steadfast in his loyalty to Empress Lilandra during the attempted coup of the Shi'ar throne by her sister [[Deathbird]], which pitted [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] and [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] against the Guard once again.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

Mentor was one of the Imperial Guard members stationed on Earth for a time.<ref>''Imperial Guard'' #1–4</ref>

In the battle between the Imperial Guard and [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]], he acted as a tactical advisor to Gladiator on Vulcan's weakness, and oversaw the temporary neutralization of his powers, establishing him as one of the survivors of the battle that proved otherwise disastrous for the Guard.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

Mentor serves as Praetor of the Imperial Guard after Gladiator becomes the new Shi'ar Majestor.<ref>''Realm of Kings: Imperial Guard'' #2</ref>

During the ''[[Civil War II]]'' storyline, Mentor represented the Shi'ar as a member of the [[Alpha Flight]] Space Program's [[Board of governors|Board of Governors]].<ref>''Captain Marvel'' Vol. 9 #6</ref>

==Inspiration==
Several of the members of the Imperial Guard are at least partly based on members of the [[DC Comics]] team [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]. ([[Dave Cockrum]], co-creator of the Guard, also had a long run as artist on the ''Legion''). Mentor is based on LSH member [[Brainiac 5]].<ref>Degaton, Per, and Will U.
