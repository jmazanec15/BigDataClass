The group was invited by Baron Zemo to join his side.<ref>''Avengers Undercover'' #4</ref> Hazmat, along with Anachronism and Cammi, were brought to be trained by Madame Masque. This is when the team devised the plan to infiltrate the Masters of Evil and take them down from within.<ref>''Avengers Undercover'' #5</ref> Over the next few months, while working for Madame Masque, Hazmat and Anachronism grew close, eventually kissing. Madame Masque seemingly lets the duo in on the plans of Baron Zemo. Hazmat is able to secretly get in contact with Hank Pym and quickly reveals what the group has been doing for the past three months and the plans of the Masters of Evil. Hazmat tries to contact Death Locket, but after she is ambushed by the Young Masters, she learns that Death Locket has betrayed the group and put Chase in a coma.

==Powers and abilities==
Hazmat constantly emits harmful radiation from her body. As a result, she is forced to wear a protective suit at all times when around others. The suit is not simply meant for containment, however, as it allows her to focus her radiation into energy bolts and other forms.

Although Hazmat's superhuman abilities manifested during her teens without obvious explanation, it has been confirmed that she is not a mutant.<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #30</ref>
