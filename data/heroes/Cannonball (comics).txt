'''Cannonball''' ('''Samuel Zachary Guthrie''') is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], commonly in association with the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Bob McLeod (comics)|Bob McLeod]], Cannonball first appeared in ''[[Marvel Graphic Novel]]'' #4: ''[[New Mutants|The New Mutants]]'' (1982).

Cannonball is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who uses the ability to fly at [[Jet aircraft|jet]] speeds while encased in an impenetrable [[Force field (science fiction)|force field]]. The eldest of a large [[Kentucky]] [[coal mining]] family, Cannonball is one of few X-Men from a [[Southern United States|southern]], [[rural]] background and has maintained the values of civility, hard work, and a strong commitment to his beliefs throughout his career as a superhero. Several of his siblings are also mutants and have joined X-Men-related teams, including his sisters, [[Husk (comics)|Paige]] and [[Aero (comics)|Melody]], and brothers [[Icarus (comics)|Jay]] and [[Jebediah Guthrie|Jeb]]. Other siblings include a brother named Lewis, and four more sisters: Joelle, Elizabeth, Cissie and another unnamed sister.

Cannonball was a founding member of the X-Men's junior team The New Mutants. He joined The New Mutants' later incarnation [[X-Force]], serving as second-in-command and field leader. He joined the X-Men, becoming the first member of a secondary team to "graduate". His tenure was complicated by clashes with superiors and he eventually rejoined X-Force and later the X-Men once more.

McLeod later commented, "I always liked Cannonball the best [of the New Mutants]. I tried to give all the mutants distinct body types and characteristics, and with his big ears and lanky frame, he was just the most fun to draw."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Buchanan|first=Bruce |title=The New Mutants: From Superhero Spin-Off to Sci-Fi/Fantasy|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=29|page=63 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=August 2008|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==

===Origin===
Sam Guthrie was born in [[Cumberland, Kentucky]]. As a young boy, he attempted to help out his family by working in the [[Coal mining|coal mine]] in which his father had worked before he died. One day, Sam finds himself trapped in a collapsing mine shaft. While trying to rescue his fellow worker, Mr. Lewis, a friend of his father's who had introduced him to the job, Sam unconsciously activates his mutant ability and uses it to save himself and Lewis from the collapsing mine. This incident leads [[Donald Pierce]] to find Sam and hire him as a mercenary for the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], to use him in a plot to attack the [[New Mutants]]. However, when Pierce orders him to kill the defeated New Mutants, Sam rebels against him. [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]] sees the good qualities inside Sam and, after saving him from Pierce, asks him to join his New Mutants. Cannonball leaves his large farming family in [[Kentucky]] to join the team.<ref>''Marvel Graphic Novel'' #4: ''The New Mutants''</ref>

===New Mutants===
[[File:Marfan027can.jpg|thumb|160px|''Marvel Fanfare'' #27<br />Art by Bob McLeod|left]]
As part of the New Mutants, Sam forms a close friendship with his teammate, [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]], despite their differing interests and temperaments (Sam's modest politeness against Sunspot's boastfulness and hot temper). Sam develops a brotherly affection for [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Rahne]], oblivious for some time that Rahne harbors romantic feelings for him. Sam and [[Danielle Moonstar]] act as the team's co-leaders. He also supervises other teammates, including [[Magik (Illyana Rasputin)|Magik]], [[Karma (comics)|Karma]], [[Cypher (comics)|Cypher]], [[Magma (comics)|Magma]], and [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]].

Early on in his career with the team, Cannonball visits Nova Roma and meets Magma, on whom he develops a long-standing but unrequited crush.<ref>''New Mutants'' #9-11</ref> The New Mutants and their fellow mutant students at the Massachusetts Academy, [[Hellions (comics)|the Hellions]], have a relationship that varies between uneasy friendship and outright enmity, with [[Jetstream (comics)|Jetstream]] (a Hellion with powers similar to Cannonball's) pushing himself as Sam's particular rival.<ref>''New Mutants'' #16-17, 53-54</ref>  Sam also meets and shares his first kiss with the young mutant [[Firestar]], then a student of the Massachusetts Academy. The machinations of the school's headmistress, [[Emma Frost]], however, force them apart before they can develop their relationship, though they remain good friends afterwards.<ref>''Firestar'' #2</ref>

Cannonball later on saves the life of international rock star [[Lila Cheney]], with whom he becomes romantically involved. Due to the nature of Lila's career, their relationship went slowly. Cannonball helps lead the team through many adventures, which take them across time and space, from ancient [[Scotland]] to other galaxies, even back home to Kentucky. There, he teams up with longtime X-Man [[Dazzler]] and his own brother [[Icarus (comics)|Jay]] to save Lila's life.<ref>''New Mutants Annual'' #1</ref>

While lost in [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], Sam helps a group of dwarves being attacked by [[Malekith the Accursed|Malekith]]'s warriors, at the cost of severe injury to himself. This earns him the friendship of [[Eitri]], ruler of the dwarves, and the affection of his daughter Kindra. He develops an affection towards Kindra herself.<ref>''New Mutants Special Edition''</ref>

The New Mutants find themselves under the guidance of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] at the behest of Professor Xavier.<ref>''New Mutants'' #35</ref>  Magneto's heavy handed leadership did not sit well with the team, and Cannonball began to display a measure of independence and rebellion against authority.{{issue|date=March 2014}}  These traits would grow stronger as he matured.{{issue|date=March 2014}}

The entity known as the [[Beyonder]] encounters the New Mutants, and in his curiosity, he kills them.<ref>''New Mutants'' #37</ref> They are resurrected by the Beyonder soon after, but this trauma leaves the team deeply shaken. For a time, they go with [[Emma Frost]], to her [[Massachusetts Academy (comics)|Massachusetts Academy]] to join the Hellions.<ref>''New Mutants'' #38-39</ref> They eventually recover from the trauma, especially after a fight with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], in which they are forced to rescue Warlock and Magneto.<ref>''New Mutants'' #40</ref>

While the New Mutants are at a Lila Cheney concert, Lila is kidnapped and they ally themselves with the powerful entity [[Gosamyr]]. To prevent Gosamyr's relatives from destroying the world, Lila teleports them into the sun, apparently dying with them.<ref>''New Mutants'' #67-70</ref> Afterwards the New Mutants find the [[X-Mansion]] has been destroyed, and formally reject Magneto's mentorship.<ref>''New Mutants'' #75</ref>

Following two successful team-ups with the [[X-Terminators]],<ref>''X-Terminators'' #4, ''New Mutants'' #73 and 76</ref> the group merges into the New Mutants.<ref>''New Mutants'' #77</ref> One of the new members, [[Tabitha Smith|Boom Boom]], soon becomes a primary romantic interest.

To deal with problems with Danielle's [[Valkyrior (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]] powers, the team returns to Asgard. Sam's feelings for Kindra get the team in trouble. When he sees her being threatened, he rashly rushes out to save her and all the New Mutants are captured by Hela's forces. The group is split up, but Sam manages to lead his half safely through many dangers, later reuniting with his friends. The New Mutants form a resistance army, which includes the wolf-prince [[Hrimhari]] and the [[Warriors Three]]. All manage to save [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]], who was vulnerable, from a murder attempt.<ref>''New Mutants'' #77-80, 82-85</ref>

Soon after returning to Earth, the team meets [[Cable (comics)|Cable]].<ref>''New Mutants'' #87</ref>  They then assist Cable in fighting the [[Mutant Liberation Front]].<ref>''New Mutants'' #93-94</ref>

Wolfsbane, Warlock, Rictor, and Tabitha are kidnapped from the grounds of the [[X-Mansion]] by Genoshan forces under the control of [[Cameron Hodge]]. Warlock is murdered by Hodge in an attempt to get his powers. Sam joins the X-Men on a rescue mission and Genosha's government is toppled. Rahne stays behind to help the fellow victims of Genosha's regime.<ref>''New Mutants'' #95-97</ref>

===X-Force===
Cannonball and the other New Mutants leave the X-Men's supervision,<ref>''New Mutants'' #100</ref> and join forces with the mysterious Cable to become the hard-edged [[X-Force]].<ref>''X-Force'' #1</ref> Cable names Cannonball as second-in-command and field leader of the team.{{issue|date=December 2012}} Sam is impaled and killed by the mutant [[Sauron (comics)|Sauron]] during a clash with the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]].<ref>''X-Force'' #7 (February 1992)</ref> However, only a few minutes later, he heals and returns to life.<ref>''X-Force'' #9 (April 1992)</ref> Cable reveals that he chose Sam to lead the New Mutants initially because he suspected Cannonball to be an [[Externals|External]] - a particularly rare type of mutant who is virtually immortal.{{Issue|date=February 2012}}  Cable had come to train Sam to fight [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]],{{Issue|date=February 2012}} another External who, in Cable's future time, had conquered the world. Many other Externals, such as [[Saul (comics)|Saul]] and [[Gideon (comics)|Gideon]], also come to believe Sam is one of them.{{Issue|date=February 2012}}  It is around this time that Sam's sister, Paige, is revealed to have mutant powers.{{Issue|date=February 2012}}

Though Cable did not stay with the team consistently, he and Sam developed a father-son type relationship.{{issue|date=March 2014}} Cannonball's existence as an External is disputed by [[Selene (comics)|Selene]].<ref>''X-Force'' #54</ref>  His immortality is later brought up when the time-traveling Jon Spectre hints at Sam's important role in the distant future.<ref>''X-Force'' (vol. 2) #2</ref>  Not long after Spectre's comments, Sam also survives three gunshot wounds to the chest.<ref>''[[New X-Men]]'' #27 - #28</ref>

Sam's time in X-Force is not easy, as he is considered 'out of line' by the X-Men and X-Force are considered outright criminals by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]  This devolves into a fight between a S.H.I.E.L.D. team led by [[Nick Fury]] and supported by veteran superhero [[War Machine]].<ref>''X-Force'' #20</ref> Later, any rivalries are put aside as Sam is instrumental in helping the other X-Men, particularly [[Forge (comics)|Forge]] and Wolfsbane, defeat the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #106, ''X-Force'' #38, ''Excalibur'' #82</ref>

===X-Men===
[[File:Xxm 24.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Cover to ''[[X-Treme X-Men]]'' #24.<br />Art by [[Salvador Larroca]].]]
Sam later officially accepts an invitation to join the [[X-Men]].<ref>''X-Force'' #44</ref> Initially, Sam is excited, this having been his dream since first arriving at Xavier's school. But Sam becomes unsure of himself and his abilities. He privately expresses his doubts to [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], causing the veteran X-Man much discomfort. Sam battles the head of the [[Shi'ar]] [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Imperial Guard]], [[Gladiator (Kallark)|Gladiator]]<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #341</ref> to a standstill, despite being overpowered, thus facing his doubts about his abilities,{{issue|date=March 2014}} only to be left behind as the rest of the X-Men were taken into space to save the Shi'ar Empire.{{issue|date=March 2014}}  This leads Sam to again question his place on the X-Men.{{issue|date=March 2014}}

Cannonball finds his relationship with Tabitha strained, and she turns to Sam's best friend, Sunspot, for "support".{{issue|date=March 2014}} Sam leaves the X-Men to help his ailing mother.{{issue|date=March 2014}} During his time with the X-Men, he also infiltrates the presidential campaign of anti-mutant candidate [[Graydon Creed]], using the alias "Samson Guthry".{{issue|date=March 2014}}  Despite the rather transparent alias, Sam is able to remain undetected until Creed is assassinated on the eve of the election.{{issue|date=March 2014}}

Cannonball rejoins X-Force, now independent of Cable and operating in [[San Francisco]].{{issue|date=March 2014}} Cannonball becomes team leader again, after the injuries sustained by [[Siryn]].{{issue|date=March 2014}} The team find a new mentor in [[Pete Wisdom]], who introduces the team to the world of [[espionage]].{{issue|date=March 2014}} Sam and Tabitha get back together.{{issue|date=March 2014}} After Wisdom's [[Comic book death|alleged death]],{{issue|date=March 2014}} Sam leads the team again and attempts to continue Wisdom's crusade.{{issue|date=March 2014}} Eventually, Sam and the other members of X-Force had to fake their deaths.{{issue|date=March 2014}}

===X-Corporation===
After X-Force's dissolution, Cannonball joins several of his former teammates and former members of [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]], in the [[Paris|Paris, France]] branch, of Professor X's international mutant task force [[X-Corporation]].{{issue|date=March 2014}} On a mission, later found to involve the [[Weapon Plus]] program, his teammate [[Darkstar (comics)|Darkstar]] dies.{{issue|date=March 2014}}  At her funeral, Xavier gives Cannonball a note with the whereabouts of Lila Cheney.{{issue|date=March 2014}} Sam decides to take time away from the X-Corporation.{{issue|date=March 2014}} He works for a time cleaning up damages to the [[Chunnel]], which was partially destroyed in the mission which killed Darkstar.{{issue|date=March 2014}}

===Back to basics===
While away, Sam rekindled his romantic relationship with Lila Cheney for a time. Sam couldn't find peace with his life, so he was asked by [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] to join her [[X-Treme X-Men]], a group of X-Men operating outside of Professor X's leadership. For a time, he even was partnered with his old friend Wolverine during an adventure where they pursued long time X-Man foe [[William Stryker]]. Sam also found himself having a reunion of sorts with former teammates Sunspot and [[Magma (comics)|Magma]]. He and his teammates rejoined the central X-Men, after the events of ''[[X-Men: Planet X|Planet X]]''. Sam is injured on a mission and once again decided to break for some peace. He uses the time to work on his own farm, which he had bought with his X-Corporation paychecks. While on the farm, Sam found himself teaming up again with Cable and reformed X-Force against the threat of the [[Skornn]].

Sam and former X-Force teammate, [[Siryn]], went in search of Cable with the [[mercenary]] [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]], who could track the missing man via a unique teleportation bond the two shared. Deadpool derisively refers to Sam as "Cannonballs".<ref>''[[Cable & Deadpool]]''</ref>

Sam has once more joined the active roster of the X-Men, whose team is co-led by [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] and [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]]. For a while, he watches over the younger, more carefree students at the X-Mansion. He also functions as a member of the [[X-Treme Sanctions Executive]] (XSE). He has already participated in helping [[X-Men: The 198|the 198]] and fighting the [[Shi'ar]] Death Commandos. He soon suffers the death of his brother [[Icarus (comics)|Jay]], who is killed by William Stryker. In the first part of ''The First Foursaken'' story arc, Cannonball went with the X-Men to [[Central Park]], where they fight the Foursaken, who then capture the X-Men and sent them elsewhere. After escaping, Cannonball accompanies the X-Men to Africa to help Storm assist mutant refugees.

===Rogue's team===
Cannonball serves on Rogue's team of X-Men.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #188</ref>  After defeating the [[Children of the Vault]], Rogue announced the departure of her team from the mansion. Sam explained his personal feelings about leaving to [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], saying that he felt he needed to leave because of Jay's death and said that every time he walked through the door, he felt he was stepping on Jay's grave.

After the team fights the Hecatomb and Rogue suffers a severe mental injury, the team decide to rest in Rogue's childhood home, but are betrayed and attacked by the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]] who are on a mission to retrieve [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]]'s [[Destiny (Irene Adler)#The Books of Truth|Diaries]]. It was revealed that [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] is an accomplice of the Marauders. After the surprise blitz, [[Emma Frost]] (who was trying to help Rogue) was disabled by a [[neurotoxin]], but was able to upload everything she picked out of what was at the edges of the Marauders' psi-shielding into Sam's mind and takes limited possession over his body, causing him to flee (unwillingly) from the battle with Iceman. Aboard the [[Blackbird (comics)|Blackbird]], the two are engaged in midair by [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]], who cripples the jet. Cannonball manages to escape and battle Shiro, who reveals that he killed Cable. Cannonball shakes it off, explaining that it "wouldn't matter who told me that, ah'd still be sayin' 'show me the body.'"

Sam and Iceman, telepathically prompted by Emma Frost, attempted to recover the Destiny Diaries, which are hidden in a dilapidated brewery.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #203</ref>  The Marauder's master, [[Mister Sinister]], used a reverse-engineered version of Xavier's [[Cerebro]] to track the pair of X-Men to the brewery. The Marauders attacked Sam and Iceman and overtook them. After the battle, Sinister attempted to telepathically erase Sam's mind so that the X-Men would find him as an empty shell. This would serve as a lesson to them and to the Marauders as well. However, Sinister was distracted by Iceman, allowing Sam to activate his power to rocket his way out of the brewery and escape. Iceman was also able to escape, but it was revealed that Sam, who crashed through one of the brewery's walls, was seriously injured. It was discovered that his blast field, which protects him from concussive impact when he uses his power, was not working properly. As a result, Sam received compound fractures of the upper and lower legs, a broken collar bone, and other injuries.

Sam lies unconscious in the X-Mansion's infirmary.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #204</ref>  Dr. [[Beast (comics)|Henry McCoy]] attends to his injuries and evaluates his condition. He notes that Sam's brain scan indicates sluggish and non-continuous activity. However, at the end of the issue, Sam is shown conscious, alert, and speaking clearly to Iceman. He quickly recovers and is capable of taking part in the final fight against the Marauders.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #207</ref>  It has yet to be seen if he has suffered any lingering mental effects from his ordeal at the hands of Mr. Sinister.

===Divided We Stand===
After Cyclops disbands the X-Men, Cannonball goes home. Paige picks him up at the airport, extremely happy to have him back with the family - she tells him he's lucky they're not all there to mob him. Sam is moody and withdrawn, and as they drive, he asks Paige to stop at a local bar. As soon as he walks in, the local men begin to glare at him, and the bartender asks him not to start anything. Paige knows that Sam came to the bar for a fight, as it's filled with members of the Cabot family. Soon the Cabots confront Sam, and he pushes them to attack him, which they happily do. Paige refuses to participate, and Sam defeats all four men alone. She demands to know what's wrong with him, and he angrily blasts off into the sky, saying he should have never come home.<ref>''X-Men: Divided We Stand'' #1 (2008)</ref>

Later, the newly formed Young X-Men team is tricked by Donald Pierce, who had disguised himself as Cyclops and gathered the Young X-Men for his own ends. Donald Pierce tells them the new [[Sunspot (comics)|Lord Imperial]] of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] has formed a new incarnation of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]]. This Brotherhood is said to consist of Sunspot, Magma, Dani Moonstar and himself. Eventually, he helps the Young X-Men come to realize they have been tricked.<ref>''Young X-Men'' #5</ref>

===Manifest Destiny===
Sam is soon called by Cyclops, informing him that the X-Men are reforming and establishing themselves now in San Francisco. Sam agrees to join this new team. He arrives in San Francisco just as Magneto is attacking the city with a group of antique [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]]. Sam manages to plow into Magneto, disarming his artificial magnetism suit, and allowing the X-Men the upper hand in the battle. However, Magneto still manages to escape.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #500</ref>  He is later seen at a bar with Karma and Dani Moonstar, where he reveals himself to be disillusioned by the idea of changing the world and instead is content with making sure no one else dies the way his brother Jay did. He is called upon to help deal with Empath.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #503</ref>

===Secret Invasion===
Sam is seen working alongside [[Armor (comics)|Armor]] and [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] when the [[Skrull]]s invade San Francisco.<ref>''Secret Invasion: X-Men'' #1</ref>

===Reforming the New Mutants===

During their mission, Magik reappears back at the X-Men's base in San Francisco after teleporting off into the future after the events of "X-Infernus". Upon her return, she informs Sam and Roberto that Shan and Dani are in trouble and it will result in their deaths. When asked what he thinks about the situation, Sam says that when it comes to the ''New Mutants'', he doesn't need to think about it. He assembles a team consisting of himself, Sunspot, Magma and Magik to go find them. While searching for them, Sam and Roberto come across a tied up and unconscious Shan in the back of a bar, while Magik and Magma are tricked into freeing [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|Legion]] from a box.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #1</ref>

The personalities in Legion's mind want to kill Dani because she can help Legion get them under control. Legion locates Dani in a jail cell and is about to kill her when Sam stops him. Dani tells Sam to let her out but Sam refuses, saying she'll be safer in the cell since she doesn't have her powers anymore. Sam and Roberto go off to fight Legion leaving Dani behind. Unbeknownst to them, one of Legion's personalities has the ability to project himself and is stalling them while he prepares to kill Dani only to be stopped by Magik and Magma. They free Dani as Legion retreats, Sam apologizes but gets punched in the face by an angry Dani. When asked where she's going Dani replies "to make myself useful"; she returns brandishing numerous firearms and tells the others that they're going after Legion.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #3</ref> However Sam tells Dani to go, she isn't a mutant anymore and to stop pretending she is because one of the most powerful mutants on earth wants her dead. Dani, upset gets into a van and drives away only to turn back minutes later after Sam and the rest of the New Mutants are badly beaten. After Legion is caught, Sam tries to apologize but Dani limps away, ignoring him. Sam confesses to Cyclops he feels as if he has messed up but Cyclops congratulates him on keeping everyone alive and that's all that matters.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #4</ref>

They're later approached by a future version of [[Danielle Cage]] as Captain America, who tells them that her nemesis, the Golden Skull, came to their timeline to steal all the wealth in the world. In [[Miami, Florida]], the team crashes a charity gala only to discover that the wealthy CEOs were kidnapped and replaced by robots. During the battle, the team manages to defeat and capture the Golden Skull, who was wearing a golden armored suit. Danielle then goes back to her timeline with the Golden Skull as her prisoner.<ref>''U.S.Avengers'' #1-3</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Cannonball is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who possesses the ability to bodily generate thermo-chemical energy and release it from his skin. This energy is used as thrust to cause his body to be propelled through the air like a rocket, at great heights and speeds with considerable maneuverability. He can control his speed and direction through sheer act of will. At first, he could only release this energy from his feet and legs, but now he can fire it from almost any part of his body, to a wide variety of effects. This energy also manifests itself as an impenetrable and virtually indestructible "blast field" that protects him from bodily harm. He can use this blast-field for the following effects: to function as a personal shield or extending it to encompass others, to shape the field around another person to imprison them, or to absorb outside kinetic impact into his own energy supply, enabling him to increase the bludgeoning power of his blows or to create explosive shock waves upon impact.

His power levels have varied over the years - but at his peak, he has been able to absorb (and redirect) the force of one of [[Gladiator (Kallark)|Gladiator]]'s punches.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #341 (February 1997)</ref>

He may also be a member of the immortal mutant group the [[Externals]], due to his apparent ability to return to life after death.<ref>''X-Force'' #9 (July 1993)</ref>
