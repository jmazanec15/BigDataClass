'''Windshear''' ('''Colin Ashworth Hume''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. 

==Fictional character biography==
Colin Ashworth Hume was born in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]; he moved with his family to Great Britain when he was five years old, and grew up in England as a Canadian expatriate. He found work as a special operative, using his mutant powers for the superhuman division of [[Roxxon]] Oil Corp's United Kingdom branch, where he was given a suit of armor.

When Hume was unable to defeat a machine-creature at Roxxon's Denver Energy Research station, Roxxon called in [[Madison Jeffries]], at the time known as [[Box (comics)|Box]] who was aided by [[Diamond Lil (comics)|Diamond Lil]].<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #87</ref> Windshear, Box, and Diamond Lil encountered the "[[Muir Island]] [[X-Men]]", and recruited [[Forge (comics)|Forge]] to help battle the machine-creature; with Forge, Windshear discovered [[Guardian (Marvel Comics)|James MacDonald Hudson]] at the core of the machine-creature.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #88</ref>  Hume, upset over the truth of Roxxon's practices, quit Roxxon Oil and returned to Canada with the members of [[Alpha Flight]], and he was soon accepted onto the team of adventurers as a probationary member.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #90</ref>

Alongside Alpha Flight, the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], and [[Human Torch]], Windshear battled the [[Fantastic Four]] and Alpha Flight members controlled by [[Headlok]].<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #94</ref> Before long, his background as a Canadian citizen was revealed, and he was elected to full membership in Alpha Flight.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #95</ref> He and Alpha Flight battled an oil spill and tanker fire.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #96</ref> He and the team defended [[Kismet (Marvel Comics)|Kismet]] against the Consortium; this was his first encounter with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], [[Nova (Frankie Raye)]], and [[Galactus]].<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #98-100</ref> Windshear was then appointed the Chief Administrator of Alpha Flight.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #102</ref> He even becomes a mentor for [[Beta Flight]].{{Issue|date=July 2009}} Windshear is one of the many superheroes who travels to alternate dimensions in the ''[[Infinity War]]'' crossover.{{Issue|date=July 2009}} He also participates in the ''[[Infinity Crusade]]''. He is one of the mind-controlled lackeys of the ''[[Goddess (comics)|Goddess]]''.<ref>''The Infinity Crusade'' #1 (Jun 1993)</ref> He and his brainwashed allies travel out to confront his former friends when their escape pods land all around the Goddess' citadel.{{Issue|date=July 2009}} He is defeated by the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], who phases his hand partway through his body. This causes intense pain and Windshear blacks out.{{Issue|date=July 2009}}

Eventually, the Canadian government disbanded Department H and the Flight programs, and Hume returned to England.{{Issue|date=July 2009}} Hume set up a curio shop to sell objects created with "hard air," and his objects command a high price. When the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] were investigating a series of murders committed with bullets created out of hard air, they investigated Hume and learned of Roxxon's connection.{{Issue|date=July 2009}}

He was shown to be depowered<ref>''New Avengers'' #18</ref> and in the wake of M-Day, he has opened up a gallery in England, displaying many of the sculptures he has created with 'hard air' before the loss of his powers.{{Issue|date=July 2009}} A depowered Hume took up the secret identity of Chinook and continues fighting crime in Toronto.<ref>''Death of Wolverine: The Logan Legacy'' #2</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Windshear is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with the ability to project "hard-air" molecules that can be used for various effects. He has the ability to create constructs of "hard-air" molecules, to project streams of "hard-air" molecules from his hands as concussive force, and to utilize "hard-air" molecules for propulsion in flight.

Windshear's armor was developed for him by Roxxon Oil technicians to fully harness his power. Turbojets built into the armor enable Windshear to better control his projection of "hard-air" molecules from his gauntlets and propulsive force from his boots. The battle-suit also grants him superhuman strength and durability, and the ability to fly at subsonic speeds via electrically powered turbines in the boots and jetpack in conjunction with his "hard-air" molecule projection. Later, his armor was modified by [[Alpha Flight]] when they all wore identical red costumes as a team. The armor also has a retractable protective tinted [[acrylic glass]]/plexiglass faceplate and a radio communicator built into the helmet.

===Mutant or mutate===
In his appearances in ''Alpha Flight'' it was stated that Windshear was not a mutant but in fact gained his powers when he was tested on by [[Roxxon]] while an agent for them.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}  It was later confirmed that Windshear first showed signs of his abilities when he was a teenager, explaining that he already possessed his powers before he worked for Roxxon.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #124</ref>  Adding support to this claim, he appears in the list of mutants depowered by the [[Scarlet Witch]] on [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].{{Issue|date=June 2009}}
