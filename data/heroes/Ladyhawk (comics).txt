'''Ladyhawk''' ('''Rosetta Morgan''' and '''Regina Morgan''') is the shared codename of a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The characters appeared in the series ''[[Spider-Girl]]''. Their first names were revealed to be Rosetta and Regina in ''[[Amazing Spider-Girl]]'' #7; their last names were revealed in the ''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z #4''.

==Fictional character biography==
Twin sisters Rosetta and Regina were the daughters of a crime lord. They decided to use their skills to fight crime. Rosetta was a great fighter, while Regina was skilled with technology. They sought training from [[Spider-Girl]]'s mentor, Phil Urich (the former good [[Green Goblin]]), and soon were ready to face the forces of evil. The twins decided to share one identity rather than design two. They developed a green-and-orange costume very similar to the costume worn by the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] before he was given his wings. They adopted the codename "Ladyhawk", and proceeded to become a superhero. 

They set up a "rule", that only one twin would use the identity at a time, so that people wouldn't suspect that Ladyhawk was really two girls. Individually, the Ladyhawk twins fought alongside (and sometimes with) Spider-Girl. The twins were very close, and when one was out in the field, the other would monitor their progress over the radio headset built into their cowl. As time progressed, Rosetta began to use the identity more than her intellectual sibling.

Rosetta (as  Ladyhawk) joined with Spider-Girl, [[The Buzz (comics)|The Buzz]], [[Darkdevil]], [[Raptor (Marvel Comics)#Brenda Drago|Raptor]], and [[Phil Urich]] (as [[Green Goblin#Phil Urich|Green Goblin]]) in the formation of a new [[New Warriors]] team. Regina also joined, but only when her sister wasn't present. When [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] began to infuse heroes with dark energy that made them very hostile, he chose the combative Ladyhawk, and the brainy twin actually had to confront her physically stronger sister, until the spell was broken. 

The [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]], in an attempt to separate Spider-Girl and her friends, brutally attacked the Ladyhawk twins, and left their comatose bodies chained to a fence. His attack left Regina so badly injured she needed to use a wheelchair, while Rosetta blamed herself for Regina's condition. As Ladyhawk she began a vendetta against Hobgoblin,<ref>''Amazing Spider-Girl'' #7, (June 2007)</ref> and eventually confronted her father about Hobgoblin's actions leading him to send his gang to attack the costumed villain.

==Powers and abilities==
The Ladyhawk twins are skilled in a variety of martial arts styles. Both of the twins are quite formidable opponents, but there is enough variation between their fighting styles for a trained eye (like Spider-Girl) to tell the two apart. They supplement their fighting skills with weapons, such as falcon-shaped [[shuriken]], smoke bombs, capture rings, and sonic-throwing blades.
