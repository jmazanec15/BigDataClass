==Powers and abilities==
Electron is a member of the alien race known as the Shi'ar, making his physical abilities higher than that of the average human. He is a good hand-to-hand combatant, trained in armed and unarmed combat by the Shi'ar Imperial Guard.

Electron has the ability to project electromagnetic energy and move metallic objects.

Electron's costume consists of Shi'ar fabrics and body armor mimicking the properties of unstable molecules, making them non-conductive.

==Inspiration==
Several of the members of the Imperial Guard are at least partly based on members of the [[DC Comics]] team [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]. ([[Dave Cockrum]], co-creator of the Guard, also had a long run as artist on the ''Legion''.) Electron is based on LSH member [[Cosmic Boy]].<ref>Kaminski, John. {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/electronimpguard.htm|Electron}} Accessed Apr. 22, 2009.</ref>
